# fortune
Quips I've assembled for fortune, cowsay, etc.

## Howto

Run the install.sh to compile the database and copy the files to the fortune directory.

**NOTE:** The install script uses sudo for the copy, so you will need sudoer or root permissions.

Then:

> fortune -e ksaj

This should also work with cowsay and all the other fortune variants.
