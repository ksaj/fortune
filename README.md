# fortune
Quips I've assembled for fortune, cowsay, etc.

## Howto

Run the install.sh to compile the database and copy the files to the fortune directory.

**NOTE:** The install script uses sudo for the copy, so you will need sudoer or root permissions.

Then:

> fortune -e ksaj

This should also work with cowsay and all the other fortune variants.

## Update frequency

I'll only be updating it when I see a quote I'd like presented in my login. So it could be often, or rarely. It's really for my own entertainment, but made public for anyone who wants to see how to create their own fortunes.

Only $49.99 to start, and then 99 cents / month thereafter. Just kidding. Public domain. Do with it what you wish. Enjoy!
