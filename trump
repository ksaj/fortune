Trade wars are good and easy to win
%
I have a great relationship with the blacks.
%
I will build a great wall -- and nobody bulds walls better than me, believe me -- and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great wall on our sothern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.
%
The beauty of me is that I'm very rich.
%
It's freezing and snowing in New York. We need global warming!

When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say China, in a trade deal? I beat China all the time. All the time.

I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just a kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.
%
You know, it really doesn't matter what [the media] write, as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.
%
I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.
%
All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me--consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.
%
My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actualy make my enemies tell the truth.
%
Before a show, I'll go backstage and everyon'es getting dressed, and everything else, and you now, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it... You know, they're standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.
%
They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the woment had become doctors. And I wasn't interested.
%
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
%
I'm [the Democrats'] worst nightmare.
%
[Ariana Huffington] is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man -- he made a good decision.
%
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, they're  sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.
%
My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well been documented, are various other parts of my body.
%
I take advantage of the laws of the nation. Because I'm running a company.
%
I did try and fuck her. I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married.
%
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
%
Our great African American president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.
%
I thin the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.
%
I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. The total is $8,737,540,000 USD. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag.
%
I'm not a schmuck. Even if the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, I wn't lose a penny.
%
What is it at 35 [years of age]? It's called check-out time.":
%
No, I have no age -- I mean, I have age limit. I don't want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know, 12 year olds.
%
i would say I'm the best all-time judge. Don't forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.
%
I know nothing about the inter-workings of Russia.
%
%
[Not paying federal income taxes] makes me smart!
%
Some people have an ability to negotiate. It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
%
It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway. 
%
Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so.
%
I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist.
%
I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.
%
People think I'm a gambler. I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines. It's a very good business being the house.
%
I'm a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision
%
You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.
%
In my life, there are two things I've found I'm very good at: overcoming obstacles and motivating good people to do their best work.
%
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
%
I'm gonna be dating her [a 10 year old girl]  in ten years.
%
I'm conservative, and even very conservative. But I'm quite liberal and getting much more liberal on health care and other things. I really say: What's the purpose of a country if you're not going to have defensive and health care? If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. I mean, it's no good. So I'm very liberal when it comes to health care. I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.
%
People want me to [run for president] all the time … I don’t like it. Can you imagine how controversial I’d be? You think about [Bill Clinton] and the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine?
%
I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.
%
So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.
%
It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.
%
I love beautiful women, and beautiful women love me. It has to be both ways.
%
Watch, listen, and learn. You can't know it all yourself—anyone who thinks that they do is destined for mediocrity.
%
I don't like firing people. It's not a pleasant thing and it's sad.
%
["You're Fired!"] There's a beauty in those two words. When you utter those words, there's very little that can be said. There's a succinctness to those words.
%
I thought today’s women were independent and had a lot of sexual freedom. ... Well, I guess they fooled me.
%
I sort of hope [a housing crash] happens because then people like me would go in and buy.
%
26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
%
Many people are saying it was wonderful that Mrs. Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, but they were insulted.We have enuf enemies
%
If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?
%
There is a way of beating ISIS so easily, so quickly, so effectively, and it would be so nice...I know a way that would absolutely give us guaranteed victory...the problem is then everybody will take the idea, run with it and then people will forget where it came from...I ran it past two or three people. [It's] so simple. It's like the paper clip.
%
I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know why he wouldn't release his records.
%
He's not a war hero... He's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you.
%
If you can't get rich dealing with politicians, there's something wrong with you.
%
I think that I would be a great uniter. I think that I would have great diplomatic skills. I think that I would be able to get along with people very well. I've had a great success in my life. I think the world would unite if I were the leader of the United States.
%
Look at that face! [of Carly Fiorina] Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?
%
This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
%
Why aren’t we letting ISIS go and fight Assad and then we pick up the remnants?
%
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on...
%
We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice.
%
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. ... We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. 
%
I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. 
%
I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. 
%
I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters. It's like incredible. No, they say, "Trump we love you too." 
%
But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall.
%
Torture works, okay folks?
%
I love the poorly educated.
%
I promise you, I will not be taking very long vacations, if I take them at all. There’s no time for vacations. We’re not going to be big on vacations.
%
I can be presidential, but if I was presidential I would only have - about 20% of you would be here because it would be boring as hell.
%
I love working. I’m not a vacation guy. Right? Like Obama, he plays golf in Hawaii. He flies in a 747.
%
If you love what you do, you’re happy. You don’t take vacations.
%

u've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care.
%
Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!
%
I think I am actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
%
Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
%
The things that were said about me. … You know what, I wanted to hit a couple of those speakers so hard. ... I was gonna hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was gonna hit this guy so hard, his head would spin. He wouldn't know what the hell happened.
%
Putin said I was a genius.
%
I think [Anthony Weiner is] a pervert. It’s dangerous to allow him on the convention floor.
%
There will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
%
 I have one of the great temperaments. I have a winning temperament.
%
I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him.
%
The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.
%
President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
%
Don’t worry about that baby. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. 
%
I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf.
%
I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician.
%
We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "confidential" or "classified".
%
For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans. How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?
%
Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.
%
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
%
We have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
%
Honestly, she should be locked up. She should be. Should be locked up.
%
Believe me: She [one of the women accusing him of sexual assault] would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.
%
Such a nasty woman. 
%
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win.
%
And I have to give the FBI credit, that was so bad, what happened, originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made, in light of the kind of opposition he had, with their trying to protect her from criminal prosecution, you know that.
%
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
%
Drain the Swamp
%
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
%
I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now.
%
I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious...
%
And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. 
%
Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind.
%
I don’t care about my company. ... Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country.
%
To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people.
%
The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel.
%
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
%
I've always felt the need to pray...I would say that the office is so powerful that you need God even more.
%
For us here in Washington, we must never ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to His will.
But we had tremendous success on The Apprentice and, when I ran for President, I had to leave the show, that's when I knew for sure I was doing it, and they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes, it's been a total disaster, and Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those rating, OK?
%
Who is the state senator? Do you want to give me his name? We'll destroy his career.
%
As far as people, Jewish people, so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren...
%
I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
%
This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.
%
You know what uranium is, right? It's a thing called nuclear weapons and other things like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.
%
Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.
%
So what happens is, I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq. [Interviewer interrupts to correct him] Yes, heading toward Syria.
%
So this is promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America. And, now, there’s a lot of words I won’t bother reading everything.
%
I think we've done more than perhaps any president in the first 100 days.... Not since [President] Harry Truman has anybody done so much.
%
I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job.
%
I'm not under investigation.
%
Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm fucked.
%
Despite the constant negative press covfefe
%
History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters.
%
I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions I just don't want a poor person.
%
We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, so it creates energy, and pays for itself. And this way Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good, right, is that good?
%
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
%
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!
%
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
%
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John.
%
I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I’m in front of the boy scouts, right?
%
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?
%
North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. 
%
I think there's blame on both sides, you look at, you look at both sides, I think there's blame on both side, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.
%
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented. It's that socialism has been faithfully implemented.
%
The media is — really, the word, I think one of the greatest of all terms I’ve come up with is "fake". I guess other people have used it, perhaps, over the years, but I’ve never noticed it.
%
Now some people might call him the King of China, but he's called President.
%
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
%
Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart...
%
Right now, in a number of states, the laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the ninth month. It is wrong, it has to change.
%
Because in America people don't worship government. They worship God.
%
We have to do it gently because we’re in the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very gentle. We will very gently take that kit, and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t hit her and injure her arm.
%
The border with the Sahara can't be bigger than ours with Mexico.
%
When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!
%
This is a tough hurricane. One of the wettest we've ever seen from a standpoint of water.
%
You know they have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned, it's called a nationalist  And I say 'really, we're not supposed to use that word?' Do you know what I am? I'm a nationalist.
%
Now how ridiculous: we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits
%
Right now, we're at the cleanest we've ever been, and that's very important to me. But if we're clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so goodA
%
One of the problems that a lot of people like myself we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. 
%
I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I won't blame you for it. The last time, you shut it down. It didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down.
%
We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
%
Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith
%
In fact, I think I can say this, Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. He said: "I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize." I said, 'Thank you.'
%
Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan, and they had alarms going off — you know that. Now all of the sudden they feel good, they feel safe. I did that.
%
There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no crime.
%
The kidney has a very special place in the heart.
%
Why do we want all these people from shithole countries coming here?
%
Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.
%
Name one country run by a black person that's not a shithole... Name one city.
%
Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico is making a fortune. off the United states. Mixico's gonna pay for the wall, and they're gonna be happy about it.
%
That's central casting, You can't cast -- you don't have anybody in Hollywood that looks like these guys.
%
So you'll be a movie star, the way you look.
%
These guys are central casting -- like from a movie, except better. They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better-looking in a certain way.
%
Look at them. Central casting. There's no Hollywood set where you could produce people that look like them.
%
He's got 10 people standing behind him. Every one is central casting. Central casting. Glasses, pad...
%
...the question you have to ask is 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' because Epstein had an island that was not a good place as I understand it, and I was never there. So you have to ask, 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' If you find that out, you're going to know a lot.
%
I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.
%
No President has done what I've done.
%
In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that.
%
I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.
%
Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it.
%
Nobody has done a job like I've done.

We're building tremendous numbers of miles of wall right now in different locations. It all comes together likes a beautiful puzzle.
%
I am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person.
%
In six years, when I'm not here, The New York Times goes out of business very quickly.
%
We wiped out the caliphate, 100%. I did in record time.
%
So when I went to Dayton, and when I went to El Paso, and I went into those hospitals, the love for me -- and me, maybe, as a representative of the country -- but for me -- and my love for them was unparalleled.
%
It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.
%
Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.
%
My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?
%
We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.
%
We have a series of magnificent buildings; we call them bungalows.
%
I don't do things for political reasons.
%
I do nothing for politics. I know a lot of you aren't going to -- you're going to smile at that. I do nothing for politics.
%
Russia has its submarine -- that's where they do their submarine work, and that's where they dock large and powerful submarines.
%
I have a lot of feeling for President Xi. He's very outstanding in so many ways.
%
I love the UK. I own great property in the UK. I love the UK. I have no idea how my property is doing because I don't care. But I own Turnberry, and I own in Aberdeen, and I own in Ireland, as you know -- Doonbeg -- and great stuff.
%
And I'm an environmentalist. A lot of people don't understand that. I have done more environmental impact statements, probably, than anybody that's -- I guess I can say definitely, because I have done many, many, many of them.
%
And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!
%
[Fox] should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win. Too Bad!
%
There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt!
%
[Fox] isn't working for us anymore! ... We have to start looking for a new News Outlet.
%
When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!
%
Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!
%
...we have a Fed problem. They don’t have a clue!
%
Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.
%
Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president, and there are no consequences.”
%
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. 
%
Witch hunt!
%
[William Barr is] one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!
%
I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them? They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?
%
I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!
%
 I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I've seen some Category 4's -- you don't even see them that much. (re: Hurricane Dorian)

A Category 5 is something that -- I don't know that I've ever even heard the term other than I know it's there. That's the ultimate (re: Hurricane Dorian)

The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore!
%
The incompetent Mayor of London, Sadique (sic) Kahn, was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday.
%
Kahn... is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!
%
Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!
%
Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. [re: Hurricane Dorian. Alabama was definitely NOT in its path.]

NAFTA is the worst Trade Deal ever made - terrible for labor.
%
Absolutely worth it, we don’t want to be servants to the Chinese! 
%
We are winning again, and we are respected again!
%
Being scolded by failed former “Intelligence” officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don’t have a clue. They really set our Country back,....
%
your favorite President, me! 
%
Kim Jong Un -- who I've gotten to know extremely well; the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me -- he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.
%
Can you believe it? I'm at 94% approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me.
%
I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I've made that wealth come alive.
%
I want clean air and clean water. And we're, right now, having the cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.
%
Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? 
%
Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!
%
.....this (Judge Thomas Ambro, Majotity Opinion), and thank God for a President like Donald J. Trump, who will appoint judges like this.
%
Kim Jong Un has been, you know, pretty straight with me, I think
%
I'm a gene believer. ... Hey, when you connect two racehorses you get usually end up with a fast horse. ... I had a good gene pool from the standpoint of that, so I was pretty much driven.
%
North Carolina will truly recover so fast. I know you people so well. Let's not even talk about it. Let's not even talk about it.
%
These are great women. I see them so much and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me.
%
You know the other side, I don't think they're big believers. They're not big believers in religion that I can tell you.
%
By the way we're building that wall and it's going up very big.
%
So now it's just different and now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them. They're a beautiful thing.

This is the real deal. Serious wall.

We have the weakest laws in the history of any country.

But it's my hair. May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot.
%
You don't have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now.
%
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. They're socialists.
%
In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or than we promised, so many more. So many more. So many more.
%
I love budgets and we'll get to that. Don't worry about it but we had to rebuild.
%
A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.
%
So in 2016, we had in my opinion, the greatest phrase in the history of politics. Make America Great Again.
%
I've gotten extremely cautious.
%
Under the normal rules, I'll be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term.
%
I'm not a vain person.

The Tallahassee Trail — must be a beautiful place. Unfortunately, he didn't go there.

We have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out.
%
We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being born very much by us. They're eating the cost.

The bulb that we're being forced to use, number one most importantly the light's no good -- I always look orange. And so do you -- the light is the worst.
%
No more cows, no more planes. I guess no more people, right. Because Kevin is just like a cow, he's just smaller.
%
They're standing behind AOC. I call her Cortez because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just go Cortez. They don't like that when you call her Cortez. But her name's Cortez, too -- too long.
%
Can you imagine those two guys in a room. Here's Xi and here's Sleepy Joe, what. Where am I? Where am I? Just sign here Sleepy Joe, just sign here.

Because one thing I've learned about politics, you can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying and then about two weeks later say the exact opposite and nobody will ever even call you on it.

Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise, they kill all the birds.
%
...is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? ... I'll be able to figure it out!
%
It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you got to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.
%
Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the $100 trillion Green New Deal. That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right?
%
Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy ... if you look at what's going on, your way of life is under assault by these people.
%
Democrats also believe any illegal alien who merely sets foot on US soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free health care for life.
%
I never did that. I never did that. That's a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida, and they talk about Alabama. That's just fake news. It was, right from the beginning, it was a fake story.
%
Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. ...The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.'
%
The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills — I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China...

By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country.

By the way, China is having the worst year they've had now in 57 years, okay? Fifty-seven. It was 27. It was 22 and then 27. It's 57 years. This is the worst year they've had.

...I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA.

I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.

We can’t have our youth be so affected, and I’m hearing it, and that’s how the First Lady got involved. She’s got a son, together, that’s a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it.

We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption.

If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.

You're talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tarrifs, okay?

PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!
%
Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!
%
This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!
%
I can do it very easily, but I'd rather not do it from the standpoint of all of the other conversations I have. I may do it, 'cause it was a very innocent call.

I think I'll get a Nobel prize for a lot of things. If they give it out fairly, which they don't.

Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!

To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff. Low ratings CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!

So many lies by Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats!

I always cooperate

The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306. Get a better candidate this time, you'll need it!

Didn't you hear — Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all — it was all over the place. I don't know — they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, 'We can't...' Essentially, he said, 'We can't beat him. Let's impeach him.' That's pretty — that's pretty dangerous stuff.

We got Choice approved. It couldn't be approved.

You are making me look like an idiot!

Well, why don't we just shoot [Mexican immigrants] in the leg? That'll slow them down.

We don’t call him shifty Schiff for nothing. He’s a shifty, dishonest guy.

Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the second amendment [the right to have a gun]. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.

His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably ... maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. But plenty of people have written that. She was extremely quiet. And it looked like she had nothing to say. (Said of a woman whose husband had just been killed in a bombing.)

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

My wife says I'm the biggest star in the world. But she might just be saying that because she's intelligent.

The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It's not a friend to freedom. It's not a friend even to the United States of America, where as all know, it has its home. And it surely isn’t a friend to Israel.

I have to start by saying I'm a big fan, a very big fan, of the United Nations and all it stands for... the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world, as far as I am concerned. So I am a big fan.

I don’t know, all I know is what’s on the internet.

It's like in golf... A lot of people - I don't want this to sound trivial - but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive... it's weird.

The line of 'Make America great again,' the phrase, that was mine, I came up with it about a year ago, and I kept using it, and everybody's using it, they are all loving it. I don't know, I guess I should copyright it, maybe I have copyrighted it.

I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney - I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney.

[John McCain is]... not a war hero. He's a war hero - he's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I Like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you.

As a kid, I was making a building with blocks in our playroom. I didn't have enough. So I asked my younger brother Robert if I could borrow some of his. He said, 'Okay, but you have to give them back when you're done.' I used all of my blocks, then all of his blocks, and when I was done I had a great building, which I then glued together. Robert never did get those blocks back.
