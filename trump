Trade wars are good and easy to win
%
I have a great relationship with the blacks.
%
I will build a great wall -- and nobody bulds walls better than me, believe me -- and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great wall on our sothern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.
%
The beauty of me is that I'm very rich.
%
It's freezing and snowing in New York. We need global warming!

When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say China, in a trade deal? I beat China all the time. All the time.

I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just a kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.
%
You know, it really doesn't matter what [the media] write, as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.
%
I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.
%
All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me--consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.
%
My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actualy make my enemies tell the truth.
%
Before a show, I'll go backstage and everyon'es getting dressed, and everything else, and you now, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it... You know, they're standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.
%
They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the woment had become doctors. And I wasn't interested.
%
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
%
I'm [the Democrats'] worst nightmare.
%
[Ariana Huffington] is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man -- he made a good decision.
%
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, they're  sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.
%
My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well been documented, are various other parts of my body.
%
I take advantage of the laws of the nation. Because I'm running a company.
%
I did try and fuck her. I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married.
%
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
%
Our great African American president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.
%
I thin the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.
%
I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. The total is $8,737,540,000 USD. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag.
%
I'm not a schmuck. Even if the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, I wn't lose a penny.
%
What is it at 35 [years of age]? It's called check-out time.":
%
No, I have no age -- I mean, I have age limit. I don't want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know, 12 year olds.
%
i would say I'm the best all-time judge. Don't forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.
%
I know nothing about the inter-workings of Russia.
%
%
[Not paying federal income taxes] makes me smart!
%
Some people have an ability to negotiate. It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
%
It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway. 
%
Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so.
%
I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist.
%
I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.
%
People think I'm a gambler. I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines. It's a very good business being the house.
%
I'm a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision
%
You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.
%
In my life, there are two things I've found I'm very good at: overcoming obstacles and motivating good people to do their best work.
%
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
%
I'm gonna be dating her [a 10 year old girl]  in ten years.
%
I'm conservative, and even very conservative. But I'm quite liberal and getting much more liberal on health care and other things. I really say: What's the purpose of a country if you're not going to have defensive and health care? If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. I mean, it's no good. So I'm very liberal when it comes to health care. I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.
%
People want me to [run for president] all the time … I don’t like it. Can you imagine how controversial I’d be? You think about [Bill Clinton] and the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine?
%
I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.
%
So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.
%
It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.
%
I love beautiful women, and beautiful women love me. It has to be both ways.
%
Watch, listen, and learn. You can't know it all yourself—anyone who thinks that they do is destined for mediocrity.
%
I don't like firing people. It's not a pleasant thing and it's sad.
%
["You're Fired!"] There's a beauty in those two words. When you utter those words, there's very little that can be said. There's a succinctness to those words.
%
I thought today’s women were independent and had a lot of sexual freedom. ... Well, I guess they fooled me.
%
I sort of hope [a housing crash] happens because then people like me would go in and buy.
%
26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
%
Many people are saying it was wonderful that Mrs. Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, but they were insulted.We have enuf enemies
%
If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?
%
There is a way of beating ISIS so easily, so quickly, so effectively, and it would be so nice...I know a way that would absolutely give us guaranteed victory...the problem is then everybody will take the idea, run with it and then people will forget where it came from...I ran it past two or three people. [It's] so simple. It's like the paper clip.
%
I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know why he wouldn't release his records.
%
He's not a war hero... He's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you.
%
If you can't get rich dealing with politicians, there's something wrong with you.
%
I think that I would be a great uniter. I think that I would have great diplomatic skills. I think that I would be able to get along with people very well. I've had a great success in my life. I think the world would unite if I were the leader of the United States.
%
Look at that face! [of Carly Fiorina] Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?
%
This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
%
Why aren’t we letting ISIS go and fight Assad and then we pick up the remnants?
%
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on...
%
We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice.
%
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. ... We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. 
%
I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. 
%
I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. 
%
I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters. It's like incredible. No, they say, "Trump we love you too." 
%
But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall.
%
Torture works, okay folks?
%
I love the poorly educated.
%
I promise you, I will not be taking very long vacations, if I take them at all. There’s no time for vacations. We’re not going to be big on vacations.
%
I can be presidential, but if I was presidential I would only have - about 20% of you would be here because it would be boring as hell.
%
I love working. I’m not a vacation guy. Right? Like Obama, he plays golf in Hawaii. He flies in a 747.
%
If you love what you do, you’re happy. You don’t take vacations.
%

u've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care.
%
Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!
%
I think I am actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
%
Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
%
The things that were said about me. … You know what, I wanted to hit a couple of those speakers so hard. ... I was gonna hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was gonna hit this guy so hard, his head would spin. He wouldn't know what the hell happened.
%
Putin said I was a genius.
%
I think [Anthony Weiner is] a pervert. It’s dangerous to allow him on the convention floor.
%
There will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
%
 I have one of the great temperaments. I have a winning temperament.
%
I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him.
%
The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.
%
President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
%
Don’t worry about that baby. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. 
%
I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf.
%
I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician.
%
We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "confidential" or "classified".
%
For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans. How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?
%
Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.
%
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
%
We have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
%
Honestly, she should be locked up. She should be. Should be locked up.
%
Believe me: She [one of the women accusing him of sexual assault] would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.
%
Such a nasty woman. 
%
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win.
%
And I have to give the FBI credit, that was so bad, what happened, originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made, in light of the kind of opposition he had, with their trying to protect her from criminal prosecution, you know that.
%
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
%
Drain the Swamp
%
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
%
I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now.
%
I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious...
%
And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. 
%
Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind.
%
I don’t care about my company. ... Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country.
%
To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people.
%
The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel.
%
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
%
I've always felt the need to pray...I would say that the office is so powerful that you need God even more.
%
For us here in Washington, we must never ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to His will.
But we had tremendous success on The Apprentice and, when I ran for President, I had to leave the show, that's when I knew for sure I was doing it, and they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes, it's been a total disaster, and Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those rating, OK?
%
Who is the state senator? Do you want to give me his name? We'll destroy his career.
%
As far as people, Jewish people, so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren...
%
I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
%
This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.
%
You know what uranium is, right? It's a thing called nuclear weapons and other things like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.
%
Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.
%
So what happens is, I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq. [Interviewer interrupts to correct him] Yes, heading toward Syria.
%
So this is promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America. And, now, there’s a lot of words I won’t bother reading everything.
%
I think we've done more than perhaps any president in the first 100 days.... Not since [President] Harry Truman has anybody done so much.
%
I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job.
%
I'm not under investigation.
%
Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm fucked.
%
Despite the constant negative press covfefe
%
History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters.
%
I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions I just don't want a poor person.
%
We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, so it creates energy, and pays for itself. And this way Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good, right, is that good?
%
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
%
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!
%
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
%
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John.
%
I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I’m in front of the boy scouts, right?
%
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?
%
North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. 
%
I think there's blame on both sides, you look at, you look at both sides, I think there's blame on both side, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.
%
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented. It's that socialism has been faithfully implemented.
%
The media is — really, the word, I think one of the greatest of all terms I’ve come up with is "fake". I guess other people have used it, perhaps, over the years, but I’ve never noticed it.
%
Now some people might call him the King of China, but he's called President.
%
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
%
Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart...
%
Right now, in a number of states, the laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the ninth month. It is wrong, it has to change.
%
Because in America people don't worship government. They worship God.
%
We have to do it gently because we’re in the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very gentle. We will very gently take that kit, and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t hit her and injure her arm.
%
The border with the Sahara can't be bigger than ours with Mexico.
%
When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!
%
This is a tough hurricane. One of the wettest we've ever seen from a standpoint of water.
%
You know they have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned, it's called a nationalist  And I say 'really, we're not supposed to use that word?' Do you know what I am? I'm a nationalist.
%
Now how ridiculous: we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits
%
Right now, we're at the cleanest we've ever been, and that's very important to me. But if we're clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so goodA
%
One of the problems that a lot of people like myself we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. 
%
I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I won't blame you for it. The last time, you shut it down. It didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down.
%
We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
%
Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith
%
In fact, I think I can say this, Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. He said: "I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize." I said, 'Thank you.'
%
Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan, and they had alarms going off — you know that. Now all of the sudden they feel good, they feel safe. I did that.
%
There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no crime.
%
The kidney has a very special place in the heart.
%
Why do we want all these people from shithole countries coming here?
%
Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.
%
Name one country run by a black person that's not a shithole... Name one city.
%
Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico is making a fortune. off the United states. Mixico's gonna pay for the wall, and they're gonna be happy about it.
%
That's central casting, You can't cast -- you don't have anybody in Hollywood that looks like these guys.
%
So you'll be a movie star, the way you look.
%
These guys are central casting -- like from a movie, except better. They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better-looking in a certain way.
%
Look at them. Central casting. There's no Hollywood set where you could produce people that look like them.
%
He's got 10 people standing behind him. Every one is central casting. Central casting. Glasses, pad...
%
...the question you have to ask is 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' because Epstein had an island that was not a good place as I understand it, and I was never there. So you have to ask, 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' If you find that out, you're going to know a lot.
%
I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.
%
No President has done what I've done.
%
In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that.
%
I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.
%
Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it.
%
Nobody has done a job like I've done.

We're building tremendous numbers of miles of wall right now in different locations. It all comes together likes a beautiful puzzle.
%
I am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person.
%
In six years, when I'm not here, The New York Times goes out of business very quickly.
%
We wiped out the caliphate, 100%. I did in record time.
%
So when I went to Dayton, and when I went to El Paso, and I went into those hospitals, the love for me -- and me, maybe, as a representative of the country -- but for me -- and my love for them was unparalleled.
%
It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.
%
Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.
%
My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?
%
We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.
%
We have a series of magnificent buildings; we call them bungalows.
%
I don't do things for political reasons.
%
I do nothing for politics. I know a lot of you aren't going to -- you're going to smile at that. I do nothing for politics.
%
Russia has its submarine -- that's where they do their submarine work, and that's where they dock large and powerful submarines.
%
I have a lot of feeling for President Xi. He's very outstanding in so many ways.
%
I love the UK. I own great property in the UK. I love the UK. I have no idea how my property is doing because I don't care. But I own Turnberry, and I own in Aberdeen, and I own in Ireland, as you know -- Doonbeg -- and great stuff.
%
And I'm an environmentalist. A lot of people don't understand that. I have done more environmental impact statements, probably, than anybody that's -- I guess I can say definitely, because I have done many, many, many of them.
%
And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!
%
[Fox] should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win. Too Bad!
%
There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt!
%
[Fox] isn't working for us anymore! ... We have to start looking for a new News Outlet.
%
When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!
%
Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!
%
...we have a Fed problem. They don’t have a clue!
%
Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.
%
Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president, and there are no consequences.”
%
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. 
%
Witch hunt!
%
[William Barr is] one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!
%
I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them? They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?
%
I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!
%
 I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I've seen some Category 4's -- you don't even see them that much. (re: Hurricane Dorian)

A Category 5 is something that -- I don't know that I've ever even heard the term other than I know it's there. That's the ultimate (re: Hurricane Dorian)

The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore!
%
The incompetent Mayor of London, Sadique (sic) Kahn, was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday.
%
Kahn... is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!
%
Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!
%
Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. [re: Hurricane Dorian. Alabama was definitely NOT in its path.]

NAFTA is the worst Trade Deal ever made - terrible for labor.
%
Absolutely worth it, we don’t want to be servants to the Chinese! 
%
We are winning again, and we are respected again!
%
Being scolded by failed former “Intelligence” officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don’t have a clue. They really set our Country back,....
%
your favorite President, me! 
%
Kim Jong Un -- who I've gotten to know extremely well; the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me -- he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.
%
Can you believe it? I'm at 94% approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me.
%
I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I've made that wealth come alive.
%
I want clean air and clean water. And we're, right now, having the cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.
%
Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? 
%
Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!
%
.....this (Judge Thomas Ambro, Majotity Opinion), and thank God for a President like Donald J. Trump, who will appoint judges like this.
%
Kim Jong Un has been, you know, pretty straight with me, I think
%
I'm a gene believer. ... Hey, when you connect two racehorses you get usually end up with a fast horse. ... I had a good gene pool from the standpoint of that, so I was pretty much driven.
%
North Carolina will truly recover so fast. I know you people so well. Let's not even talk about it. Let's not even talk about it.
%
These are great women. I see them so much and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me.
%
You know the other side, I don't think they're big believers. They're not big believers in religion that I can tell you.
%
By the way we're building that wall and it's going up very big.
%
So now it's just different and now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them. They're a beautiful thing.

This is the real deal. Serious wall.

We have the weakest laws in the history of any country.

But it's my hair. May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot.
%
You don't have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now.
%
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. They're socialists.
%
In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or than we promised, so many more. So many more. So many more.
%
I love budgets and we'll get to that. Don't worry about it but we had to rebuild.
%
A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.
%
So in 2016, we had in my opinion, the greatest phrase in the history of politics. Make America Great Again.
%
I've gotten extremely cautious.
%
Under the normal rules, I'll be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term.
%
I'm not a vain person.

She beat a man that likes flamingo dancers from Argentina. He was supposed to be vacationing on the Tallahassee trail, but he was actually in Argentina.

The Tallahassee Trail — must be a beautiful place. Unfortunately, he didn't go there.

We have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out.
%
We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being born very much by us. They're eating the cost.

The bulb that we're being forced to use, number one most importantly the light's no good -- I always look orange. And so do you -- the light is the worst.
%
No more cows, no more planes. I guess no more people, right. Because Kevin is just like a cow, he's just smaller.
%
They're standing behind AOC. I call her Cortez because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just go Cortez. They don't like that when you call her Cortez. But her name's Cortez, too -- too long.
%
Can you imagine those two guys in a room. Here's Xi and here's Sleepy Joe, what. Where am I? Where am I? Just sign here Sleepy Joe, just sign here.

Because one thing I've learned about politics, you can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying and then about two weeks later say the exact opposite and nobody will ever even call you on it.

Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise, they kill all the birds.
%
...is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? ... I'll be able to figure it out!
%
It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you got to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.
%
Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the $100 trillion Green New Deal. That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right?
%
Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy ... if you look at what's going on, your way of life is under assault by these people.
%
Democrats also believe any illegal alien who merely sets foot on US soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free health care for life.
%
I never did that. I never did that. That's a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida, and they talk about Alabama. That's just fake news. It was, right from the beginning, it was a fake story.
%
Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. ...The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.'
%
The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills — I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China...

By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country.

By the way, China is having the worst year they've had now in 57 years, okay? Fifty-seven. It was 27. It was 22 and then 27. It's 57 years. This is the worst year they've had.

...I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA.

I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.

We can’t have our youth be so affected, and I’m hearing it, and that’s how the First Lady got involved. She’s got a son, together, that’s a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it.

We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption.

If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.

You're talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tarrifs, okay?
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!
%
Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!
%
This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!
%
I can do it very easily, but I'd rather not do it from the standpoint of all of the other conversations I have. I may do it, 'cause it was a very innocent call.

I think I'll get a Nobel prize for a lot of things. If they give it out fairly, which they don't.

How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been, Cut Record Taxes & Regulations, fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years), & so much more?...

Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!

To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff. Low ratings CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!

So many lies by Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats!

I always cooperate

The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306. Get a better candidate this time, you'll need it!

We have breaking news. Trump exaggerated.

Didn't you hear — Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all — it was all over the place. I don't know — they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, 'We can't...' Essentially, he said, 'We can't beat him. Let's impeach him.' That's pretty — that's pretty dangerous stuff.

We got Choice approved. It couldn't be approved.

You are making me look like an idiot!

Well, why don't we just shoot [Mexican immigrants] in the leg? That'll slow them down.

We don’t call him shifty Schiff for nothing. He’s a shifty, dishonest guy.

Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the second amendment [the right to have a gun]. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.

His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably ... maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. But plenty of people have written that. She was extremely quiet. And it looked like she had nothing to say. (Said of a woman whose husband had just been killed in a bombing.)

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

My wife says I'm the biggest star in the world. But she might just be saying that because she's intelligent.

The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It's not a friend to freedom. It's not a friend even to the United States of America, where as all know, it has its home. And it surely isn’t a friend to Israel.

I have to start by saying I'm a big fan, a very big fan, of the United Nations and all it stands for... the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world, as far as I am concerned. So I am a big fan.

I don’t know, all I know is what’s on the internet.

You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.

It's like in golf... A lot of people - I don't want this to sound trivial - but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive... it's weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can't sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.

I have a great relationship with African Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them.

The line of 'Make America great again,' the phrase, that was mine, I came up with it about a year ago, and I kept using it, and everybody's using it, they are all loving it. I don't know, I guess I should copyright it, maybe I have copyrighted it.

I never attacked [Rand Paul] on his looks, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.

I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney - I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney.

[John McCain is]... not a war hero. He's a war hero - he's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I Like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you.

As a kid, I was making a building with blocks in our playroom. I didn't have enough. So I asked my younger brother Robert if I could borrow some of his. He said, 'Okay, but you have to give them back when you're done.' I used all of my blocks, then all of his blocks, and when I was done I had a great building, which I then glued together. Robert never did get those blocks back.

Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump -- how about Bikers for Trump? They travel all over the country. They got Trump all over the place, and they're great. They've been great. But these are tough people. These are great people. But they're peaceful people, and Antifa and all -- they'd better hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way.
%
So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell-- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.
%
Does anybody really believe [Biden] is mentally fit to be President?
%
Never has the press been more inaccurate, unfair or corrupt! We are not fighting the Democrats, they are easy, we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media. They have gone totally CRAZY.
%
Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.
%
Much of it is corrupt. It's corrupt. You have corrupt media in this country. And it truly is the enemy of the people.
%
I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden - I just don’t think it’s going to happen. Sleepy Joe won’t get to the starting gate, & based on all of the money he & his family probably “extorted,” Joe should hang it up. I wouldn’t want him dealing with China & U!
%
It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter
%
The Democrats are lucky that they don’t have any Mitt Romney types. They may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are being exposed!
%
The great Scam is being revealed!
%
...another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!
%
Schiff and the Do Nothing Dems have lost all credibility...but the corrupt Media is working hard to keep them in the game!
%
LYIN’ SHIFTY SCHIFF!
%
I’m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY
%
Not only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election, but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!
%
"Schiff is a FRAUD!"
%
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous “ass” who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!
%
The Media is “Fixed” and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The 
@nytimes & @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!
%
Schiff has also committed a crime, perhaps treason
%
He is a sick puppy!
%
Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).
%
We are simultaneously fighting the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party. Always tough to beat the “Press,” but people are beginning to see how totally CORRUPT they are, and it makes our job a whole lot easier!
%
AOC is a Wack Job!
%
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
%
ELECTION INTERFERENCE!
%
Leader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don’t have a chance!
%
Fake News, just like the snakes and gators in the moat. The Media is deranged, they have lost their minds!
%
Schiff is a lying disaster for our Country. He should resign!
%
As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!).
%
THE USA IS GREAT!
%
Hasn’t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?
%
I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena!
%
Adam should be Impeached!
%
The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!
%
We defeated the caliphate 100 percent, and now it’s time for Germany and France, and all of the nations where they came from, to take them back.  And they chose no.  And maybe they’ll — maybe they’re going to change their tune now.  I don’t know.
%
One poll had me up 12 points, 16 points, or 17 points.
%
Look, we beat you on the — we won on the Mueller scam.
%
This is the most ridiculous thing many people have ever seen.
%
We win.
%
The head is — that’s — it doesn’t get any bigger in your world.
%
We’re doing things I think that nobody thought was possible.
%
Perhaps there’ll be some changes made, and perhaps not.  But we have to be respected as a nation.
%
You have some very, very wealthy nations, extremely wealthy nations, where we take care of their military and we take care of their military needs.  Nobody can do it better than us.
%
We’ll see what happens with respect to a lot of different things.
%
Got to treat them good, and you got to take care of ISIS.
%
Turkey has been fighting them for many years.  Somebody said hundreds of years.  You had just mentioned to me yesterday, 200 years, maybe more.
%
People understand that it’s a fraud.  It’s a scam.  It’s a witch hunt.  And all we do is just keep fighting for the American people, because that’s all I do.
%
Harvey, as far as I’m concerned — the big hurricane from a year ago in Texas, which was, I guess, they say, the biggest dump of water we’ve ever had in this country, and probably so.
%
We spent a trillion and a half dollars, so at least you should get some helicopters out of it, right?
%
China is coming along well.  I actually think that tremendous progress was made over the last little while with respect to the question you just asked, having to do with Iran. So we’ll see.  We’ll see.  But it’s all going to work out — always does.  We get it to work out.  And if it doesn’t, sometimes it takes a little longer.  But I get things to work out...
%
We’re going to be doing money.  We’re going to be doing a lot of things.  We helped the state of Texas.
%
You would have been talking about anywhere from 10- to 20- or even 25,000 lives would have been lost.  So the Coast Guard has really done a job.
%
Last time, I came a few days later, and some of the areas were already — you see people out there cutting their lawn.  They had five feet of water on top of their lawn and they’re cutting their lawn a short time later.
%
Nobody has reacted to hurricanes and flooding like the Trump administration.  And nobody has helped Texas like the Trump administration has helped. 
%
You know, you never know.
%
It was the biggest election victory in India for, at a minimum, a very long time.  I think — from the beginning.  That’s a long time.
%
I would love to do whatever I want to do.  I’d love to do it.  But you have to be a little bit shy about doing that.
%
Well, we’re looking at — we’re looking at that.  You know, people don’t like that, and I don’t like it — the concept of it.  But we’re looking at it.  It’s perfect.
%
I’m not looking to hurt him because he’s got his own difficulties.
%
We don’t want a country that we’re giving massive aid to to be corrupting our system.  And we don’t want it to be corrupted in any way, but we certainly don’t want it to be corrupting our system.
%
So, we don’t want to let anything having to do with any of that really, you know, hurt our country.  So it would be fine to do it, but you will see one of the finest, one of the nicest — if we do that.  Or I’ll have somebody — I’ll give it to a respected source.  They can look at it.
%
whoever [FOX's] Pollster is, they suck.
%
It’s so different than it used to be. Oh well, I’m President!
%
Minneapolis, you have a rotten mayor. She's either really stupid, okay? Or she's really lost it. Maybe there's a little dishonesty in there someplace.
%
Hunter. You are a loser. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. 
%
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous "ass"
%
They know they can’t win on Election Day so they’re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bullshit impeachment!
%
Tomorrow, you’ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out.
%
LOUISIANA — Tomorrow, you will head to the polls and VOTE to REPLACE Liberal Democrat John Bel Edwards with a great new REPUBLICAN Governor! 
%
Is [Shepard Smith] leaving [FOX] due to bad ratings, or some other less important reason?
%
Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days.
%
Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?
%
I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS.
%
Where is Hunter Biden? He has disappeared while the Fake News protects his Crooked daddy!
%
You know how many cases I've lost and then we win?
%
Impeachment. I never thought I'd see or hear that word with regard to me. Impeachment. I said the other day it's an ugly word. To me, it's an ugly word. Very ugly word. It means so much. It means horrible, horrible crimes and things, I can't even believe it. It's a witch hunt.
%
You know, if you want to go out and buy groceries, you need identification. If you want to do almost anything you need identification. The only thing you don't need identification for is to vote, the most important single thing you're doing -- to vote. You know why? Because they cheat like hell, that's why.
%
The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country.
%
Vote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us!

Never ending wars will end!

CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS & RANCHERS!
%
We have become a far greater Economic Power than ever before, and we are using that power for WORLD PEACE!

Where’s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.
%
Don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!
%
The Endless Wars Must End!
%
Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. 
%
The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out.
%
We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!

Schiff is a lying mess!
%
I’m not a fan of Jeb Bush. Because Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core, and he’s weak on immigration. Those are two bad things.

Now that we have found out that @CNN is a virtual fraud, rumor has it that Jeff Zucker will be resigining momentarily?

Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA. Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33,000 deleted Emails, not recoverable!

Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER, EVER, EVER! How about saying it this way, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!
%
Look, we have no soldiers in Syria. We've won. We've beat ISIS. And we've beat them badly and decisively. We have no soldiers [there were 1000 troops in Syria]
%
But even if you listen to the very good conversation that I had, a very, very good, no-pressure, congenial conversation with the new president of Ukraine, he had some things that were not flattering to say about her. And that came out of the blue. [the transcripts show Trunp brought it up]
%
Nancy Pelosi said, 'Well, that's what he said. Isn't it?' But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, 'Wait a minute, that's not what I was told.' But she was stuck, she was stuck. [entirely made up]
%
've strengthened the military to a point where it's never been. The military was so depleted, we were close to not having a military.

When I came into office, a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone. He said, 'Sir, we have no ammunition.'
%
When I came in, we had no ammunition two and a half years ago.
%
You know what the 'delinquent' means? That's an old real estate term. 'He's delinquent with his rent.' They're delinquent with their payment. They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back.
%
They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back. Because if Germany doesn't pay -- they don't add that up, they just say, 'Oh, that's okay.' Then they don't pay. And yet, they're -- if you go back that way, like the old fashioned way -- like you don't pay and you owe it. But they don't pay and they just go on to the next year. They owe us hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.
%
You know, Oprah used to be a very good friend of mine.
%
They believe in open borders, where anybody can come into our country -- anybody.
%
Most of the Democrats, four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden they don't want a wall. You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it.
%
And we built and we're building a wall, and it is going up rapidly. And that is tough because I built it against every single Democrat who, four years ago, wanted it. And the only reason they don't want it now is because I want it. It's the only reason. Only one reason.
%
You go out to California, you see what's happening out there? It's a disgrace. The voter abuse, it's a disgrace what's happening in California.
%
You have people out there -- they don't get it. They don't get it. So we love the Republicans.
%
The New Green Deal or Green New Deal. You can say it either way, by the way. It doesn't matter; same thing. It doesn't matter. Somebody said, 'Which comes first?' I said, 'It doesn't make any difference. They're both crazy.' No cows, no planes, no people, no energy, no oil, no gas -- no nothing.
%
Democrats also continue to encourage foreign interference in our elections by refusing to support a simple and beautiful thing called voter ID.
%
We have no inflation.
%
Usually, when a President comes to office, there's no — you have no vacancies. Or the previous President would have — boom.
%
You go back and check it out, you'll find that others left none, usually none — or one or two — but one, none. One hundred and forty-two.
%
President Obama was not very good at getting it done, because, you know, people held him up and everything else. But, with time, you get them all done. You get them done.

Our vets are happy now. We got them Choice. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]

We approved something called Veterans Choice. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]

We got Choice for the vets. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]

Energy, look, we're now the number one energy producer in the world, oil and gas. We weren't close when I got elected. [Actually, that's been the case since 2012]
%
We've ended the war on American energy and with your help, right here in Louisiana, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet. [Actually it has been since 2012]
%
You know, I was here a couple of months ago and they opened the biggest LNG plant I have ever seen in my life. Right? Were you there? And they've been trying to get this thing approved for years and years and years and they couldn't. And then President Trump came along and I got those permits so fast for them. These big energy executives were sitting back and they couldn't get it approved. Nothing they could do, would get it approved. Your governor was lousy, they were all lousy. Nobody could help. That thing was so dead, and I came along and I got it approved . [Actually, Obama did that, and the Cameron LNG website says as much.]
%
The New York Times basically has given up journalistic standards. They've said, 'We don't care; we'll say anything.' Essentially, they're just making up stories.

We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job.

Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server.

The whistleblower's report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn't know what he was talking about or was given false information or was even worse than that.
%
If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets.
%
It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing.

There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does.
%
Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new. [There isn't anything new or updated as of yet.]

[Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] is the world’s most overrated general.

I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.

Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her “upstairs,” or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!

House Democrats are engaged in “Soviet style” tactics in their effort to attack

I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned.

The Do Nothing Democrats, Pelosi and Schumer stormed out of the Cabinet Room!

I’m fighting for the American people, but the Democrats’ sole focus is fighting against ME with their fraudulent Witch Hunt.

Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency!
%
Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!
%
Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!

Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand that they can play with.

[In letter to Ukraine President Erdogan] Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy--and I will.

If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.

I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call.
%
No one got people in the rallies as big as I did.
%
It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.
%
On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, ‘Mexico will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.
%
I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.
%
I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now.
%
This deal will make me look terrible.

O.K., this shows me to be a dope.
%
Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.
%
Russia hates ISIS. Russia hates ISIS as much as the United States does. Russia had a plane blown up by ISIS. Russia wants nothing to do with ISIS. Russia's tough, they can kill ISIS just as well, and they happen to be in their neighborhood.

Never give up. We are doing GREAT! We are WINNING!

...based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.
%
I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. 
%
...as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!
%
Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL, this time from @FoxNews, of course!

There has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt.

Such a disgrace that the Do Nothing Democrats are doing just as their name suggests, Doing Nothing! USMCA anyone?

Susan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria.

Can you believe I am doing this important work for our Country, and have to deal with Corrupt Adam Schiff and the Do Nothing Democrats at the same time? It was not intended to be this way for a President!
%
The USA!

Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption.

Tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party, the Fake News Media, and the rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State.

The radical left tolerates no dissent, it permits no opposition, it accepts no compromise, and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American People.

As the Witch Hunt continues!

The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!

FAKE NEWS!
%
Doral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats & their Partner, the Fake News Media! I’m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary! We’ll find someplace else!

All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!

The “Squad” (AOC Plus 3) and other Dems suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Crazy!

The Amazon Washington Post did a story that I brought racist attacks against the “Squad.” No, they brought racist attacks against our Nation.

The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.

I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country... They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak & insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!

[Rep. Tlaib] hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!
%
Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!
%
[Tlaib] obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.
%
[Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib] hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds.
%
[Rep. Omar] is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!
%
Dems have such disdain for Israel!
%
Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep.
%
So funny to watch Schumer groveling. 
%
We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!
%
Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!
%
Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party.
%
Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party.
%
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party.

If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical “oversight” is a joke!

And we're building a wall on the border of New Mexico and we're building a wall in Colorado, we're building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works that you can't get over, you can't get under and we're building a wall in Texas. We're not building a wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the walls we just mentioned.
%
(Kiddingly) We're building a Wall in Colorado' (then stated, 'we're not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we're building on the Border') referred to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!.

Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em, please. They don't know they're dealing with very tough people in this room... Ahh they don't know who they're dealing with!!! They don't know who they're dealing with. They just don't understand. Alright, go home to mum. Explain to mom you tried to take on very powerful people. And many of them mentally as well as physically. That's not a good thing to do in this room... Make sure you don't hurt them. Please!!!
%
Just a continuation of the Witch Hunt!
%
It would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothinepublican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don’t know), in testimony before Congress! Do Nothing Democrats allow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency....
%
The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!
%
Where’s the Whistleblower?
%
Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!
%
It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!

Our movement is a movement unlike anything our country has seen!

The Democrats Scam goes on and on! They Do Nothing!

The Witch Hunt continues!

The Do Nothing Dems have nothing but time!

Watch out for them, they are human scum!

I think [Democrats] are lousy politicians. But two things that they have, they are vicious and they stick together.

They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armor. I'll look too heavy. I don't like that.

The New York Times, which is a fake newspaper -- we don't even want it in the White House anymore. We're going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post.

Chairman Kim would not meet with [Obama]. And for some reason, we have a certain chemistry, or whatever.

The man on the other side-- the gentleman on the other side-- did not take [Obama's] call. Okay? Lack of respect. But [Chairman Kim] takes my call.

China's 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years.
%
Now, China has had their worst year in 35 years now. It was in 26 years, but now it's in 35 years.
%
China has had the worst year they've had in 27 years. And a lot of people are saying the worst year they've had in 54 years. OK?
%
[China is] having the worst year they've had, I understand, in 61 years.
%
China has now had the worst year that they've had in 57 years.

Just came out -- was it 93%?... It's like a record or something like that: 93% have a high approval rating of Trump.
%
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party.

[Baghdadi] died running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.
%
In some cases, [ISIS fighters] were very frightened puppies.
%
Jim Hood will never give us his vote, is anti-Trump and pro-Crooked Hillary.
%
The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!
%
....  [8:18 AM · Oct 26, 2019 tweet... another covfefe?]
%
The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it.
%
We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city [San Francisco] rots away.
%
Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!
%
The Democrats must end this Scam now. Witch Hunt!
%
Thank you @foxandfriends! Hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason. You will never learn this from the corrupt LameStream Media who get Pulitzer Prizes for reporting the story totally wrong.
%
The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe!
%
My lawyers should sue the Democrats and Shifty Adam Schiff for fraud!
%
Under this administration, the great betrayal of the American worker is over.
%
My goal has been to give a voice to the voiceless.
%
Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!
%
Thank you Dan. That looks like Cary Grant, doesn't he? Have you ever been told that, Dan? It's not a bad compliment, I must say. Today we have... Tomon... Arnold. And in those days you had it a little different. Those days you had Errol Flynn, Cary Grant. A little different. 
%
That's what I did best. I built good.
%
By the way, you'll never have another president like me.
%
We're building a wall in Colorado. We're building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works!
%
...Hamza bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama bin Laden, who was saying very bad things about people...
%
I don't want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect -- as though you were watching a movie. It was -- that -- that in -- the technology there alone is -- is really great.
%
... they were shot from the air ships.
%
You know, they [ISIS] use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump.
%
This is an island surrounded by water, big water, ocean water.
%
[Hamza bin Laden] was talking bad things just like his father.
%
To this day, I get people coming up to me. They said, 'You know what one of the most amazing things I've ever seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.' It's true. Now, most of the press doesn't want to write that, but, you know -- but it's true. If you go back, look at my book. [It doesn't...]
%
Then you have the case of this wise guy, Jussie Smollett who beat up himself. And he said MAGA country did it -- MAGA country ... That's a hate crime and it's a scam. It's a real big scam just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.
%
I have to say this, he hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I've never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you.

Ladies and gentlemen of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here. ... I will leave now because I am boring you to death.
%
Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldn’t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
%
He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Thank you.
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!
%
Economy Rocks!
%
I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?
%
Where’s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!
%
Ukrain said NO PRESSURE.
%
Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!
%
That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!
%
Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!?
%
Don’t worry J.J., Schiff is a leaker & corrupt politician who made up what I said on the call in order to hurt the Republican Party & me!
%
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?
%
Please stop the Dems from hurting a very good and hard-working man!
%
The Dems are a lost cause. In 2020, we need a big, beautiful WIN
%
Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the 'informant?'
%
They don't talk about [the call with the Ukrane President] anymore. They don't like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect.
%
So, Conor Lamb -- right here from Pittsburgh. And I appreciate -- Conor, whoever you are -- I have no idea what you even look like. But there's some guy named Conor Lamb who speaks very nicely about -- you know why? Because you're in like a Trump district. No, it's right. It's true. Right? 'No, the President is excellent. He's doing a good job.' I thought he was a Republican until I found out.
%
They want to take away your guns. Conor Lamb wants to take away your guns.
%
But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president.
%
I'm sure you've heard the statement, because I made it more than any human being alive.
%
I don't get any credit for this, but that's OK. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book -- a, really, very successful book.
%
So, if I weren't elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now -- they were expecting around the second year of this term.
%
We are much bigger than the China economy. And we're getting bigger, and they're not.
%
I wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of -- of Syria and knocked out a whole base...
%
The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!
%
Miami International --one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it's the biggest. But one of the biggest airports in the world.
%
...you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause...
%
The New York Times wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they're saying well, it wasn't really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly.
%
There was no anything asked for. There was no pressure whatsoever.
%
You know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they're angels. OK?
%
Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!
%
But he made it sound so horrible. That's illegal. I mean, it -- no way you can get away with that. That's a -- but that's a total fraud.
%
They didn't even know what we were talking about. To think that they're using that -- now they don't talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good. So they don't talk about it anymore...
%
China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out.
%
I was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium -- I don't know, it's got to be an arena that's got to be 20 years old ... we have a record.
%
I go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record.
%
I haven't had an empty seat at a rally.
%
Look, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime.
%
Their policies are horrible: open borders, sanctuary cities, take everyone's guns away.
%
I fought off the Mueller hoax. I fought off all of them, and it continues. It's just crazy. This has never happened to a president before.
%
The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!
%
The Impeachment Hoax is hurting our Stock Market. The Do Nothing Democrats don’t care!
%
China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway.
%
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats have gone Crazy. Very bad for USA!
%
Democrats are "vicious" but are better at remaining united.
%
The case is very simple. It's quick. It's so quick.
%
Republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now  are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process.
%
This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax.
%
This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected. Rupublicans, go with Substance and close it out!
%
I met him when I was over when I was at an incredible... We had something that was so incredible. Now that was months ago, how time flies.
%
...despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse. 
%
At some point, I'm going to sit down, perhaps as a fireside chat on live television, and I will read the transcript of the call, because people have to hear it.
%
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
%
Their light just went off. See? Look. Their light was on -- they just turned it off!
%
I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.
%
You're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls. You're read... Let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.
%
You are sooo lucky to have me as your President (just kidding!). 
%
 It is a phony scam by the Do Nothing Dems!
%
If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these... monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!
%
When's he getting off the floor, Jim? The guy's a pain in the ass.
%
‘Could you call the head of some company in Japan, please?’ I say, ‘Matt, do I have to?’ ‘Please, please.’ But isn’t that what you really want in a governor? That’s what you want. He’s such a pain in the ass, but that’s what you want.”
%
Are you talking to me???
%
If you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. And if you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me!
%
Is there any place you'd rather be than at a Trump rally on a beautiful wonderful evening in Louisiana?
%
I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?
%
With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut.
%
Don't forget in 2016, people came from the mountains and the valleys, and the rivers and the oceans. They came from all over. The democrats said, "What the hell is happening? Where are all these people coming from?"
%
The testimony has been fine.
%
The call was perfect. Now they're after a second call which nobody knew about and I guess they want that call to be produced also. So I have a second call I have with the president, which actually I believe came before this one. And now they all want that one. And if they want it, I'll give it to them.
%
We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!
%
Well, they shouldn't be having public hearings. This is a hoax. This is just like the Russian witch hunt. This is just a continuation.
%
Be quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.
%
Well, now, you've really shaped my behavior, because from the day I came in here, I've had problems with phony stuff, like a phony dossier that turned out to be false, like false investigations that I've beaten. So a lot of my behavior was shaped by the fake news and by the other side. That was a lot of my behavior.
%
I caught the swamp. I caught 'em all.
%
I caught all of this corruption that was going on, and nobody else could have done it.
%
New York is a corrupt state. It's a corrupt state, it's a shame.
%
I gave $19 million away. And what happened is, instead of saying, 'Thank you, great,' they hit me with a lawsuit and it was started by a man [former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman] who had to get out because he beat up women.
%
I'm very transparent. Nobody is more transparent than I am.
%
And I'll tell you, the whistleblower, I call him the fake whistleblower. He gave a fake report of my phone call.
%
We are winning so big. My polls are the highest they've ever been, I'm leading in all of the states, every swing state.
%
Nancy Pelosi should go back to her district, which is horrible. It's filthy. It's drug-infested. The stuff's being flown out to the ocean -- it's being wiped out to the ocean through their drainage systems.
%
We're doing very well with African Americans.
%
I know Michael [Bloomberg]. He became just a nothing. He was really a nothing. He's not going to do well, but I think he's going to hurt Biden, actually. But he doesn't have the magic to do well.
%
Little Michael [Bloomberg] will fail. He'll spend a lot of money. He's got some really big issues. He's got some personal problems and he's got a lot of other problems.
%
There is nobody I'd rather run against than Little Michael [Bloomberg].
%
Just so you know, we have the highest poll numbers. We have the most energy.
%
I have to do what the lawyers say, to a certain extent; not always, but, you know, to a certain extent.
%
There shouldn't be impeachment hearings.
%
I am sure you will find it tantalizing!
%
They're trying to stop me, because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen.
%
NEVER TRUMPERS!
%
The Democrats have stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans. They have leaked out everything.
%
Sean [Hannity] the amazing warrior!
%
A total Impeachment Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats!
%
Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from “angels.” Some are very tough, hardened criminals.
%
Both Bidens should be forced to testify in this No Due Process Scam!
%
So true, and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves, and must hate our Country!
%
Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!
%
Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!
%
To think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!
%
Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts.
%
ABC is as bad as the rest of them. Journalistic standards are nonexistent today. The press is so dishonest that we no longer have Freedom of the Press!
%
But the Witch Hunt continues. After 3 years of relentless attacks against the Republican Party & me, the Do Nothing Dems are losers for America!
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
Bringing the word “Nationalism” back into the mainstream - great job by Rich Lowry! Very important book.
%
The LameStream Media, which is The Enemy of the People, is working overtime with made up stories in order to drive dissension and distrust!
%
Anybody wants to come in -- dictators, it's OK. Come on in. Whatever's good for the United States; we want to help our people.
%
They shouldn't be having public hearings.
%
I don't care if they're public; they should be public. What I said -- it was misreported, as usual. What I said is very simple: There shouldn't be anything. There shouldn't be impeachment hearings, is what I said. So maybe they misconstrued it.
%
But here's a guy [Schiff] that made up a conversation, totally, I mean, not even like -- he didn't use one word that I said. He just totally made it up, and it sounded terrible.
%

But here's a guy [Schiff] that made up a conversation, totally, I mean, not even like -- he didn't use one word that I said. He just totally made it up, and it sounded terrible.
%
...just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don't exist.
%
With that being said, it's fake news. They wrote a fake story. We've told them that before they wrote the story. But today, when you tell the press something, it's meaningless because they write whatever -- it's all fiction. And I'll tell you, they don't have sources. You know what they do? They make it up. Not everybody -- not John, not everybody. But they make it up.
%
If our opponent had gotten in, this economy, instead of being up 60, 70%, would have been down 60 or 70%, and that's guaranteed.
%
The tape shows that Joe Biden is a crook. He's 100 percent crooked. And the fake news, which is you and you -- you don't want to do anything about it.
%
These people are bad people and it's so bad what they do to our country. They rip the guts out of a country and it's a shame, and they shouldn't be allowed to do it.
%
We are winning so big.
%
Just so you know, we have the highest poll numbers.
%
We have the highest car insurance in the entire nation by far. Some people call it auto insurance, call it whatever the heck you want.
%
We ended the war on American energy.
%
We ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.
%
The Democrats -- think of it. They want open borders, which means crime.
%
I have one problem. And it has been very hard on my family. Whoever heard — impeachment to me is a dirty word. It’s been very unfair, very hard on my family. Me, it’s my whole life, it’s crazy. What a life I lead. You think this is fun, don’t you? But it’s been very hard on my family. Very, very hard.
%
Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.
%
[To Zelensky]I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you.
%
#NewHoaxSameSwamp
%
A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?
%
So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr & Nellie, Steele & all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn’t they lie?...
%
We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost), and also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!
%
They call it “serving at the pleasure of the President.” The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O.
%
Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.

She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long.
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the......
......filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE. She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long. 
%
Democrats must apologize to USA!
%
THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS NOW DEAD!
%
the eyes of history are looking at the people of Louisiana. If you want to defend your values, your jobs, and your freedom, then you need to REPLACE... blah blah blah
%
Democrats must apologize to USA
%
A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?
%
You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight sometimes they get really treated very unfairly.
%
I have the best words.
%
I don't know him. I don't know, as he says, 'Lieutenant Colonel.' I understand somebody had him the misfortune of calling him 'Mr.' and he corrected them. I never saw the man. I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. No, I don't know Vindman at all.
%
If this were a prize fight, they'd stop it!
%
I have one of the greatest memories of all time.
%
I don’t remember much about that meeting.
%
I don't remember that, no. But I would have said Cody was a bad guy if I did.
%
As good as my memory is, I don't remember that.
%
My hearing is, and has been, great.
%
Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. 
%
FAKE & CORRUPT NEWS!
%
Corrupt politician Adam Schiff’s lies are growing by the day.
%
I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!
%
Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!
%
I am much richer than people even thought - And that is a good thing.
%
They [Apple] have it all - Money, Technology, Vision & Cook!
%
Fox should stay with the people that got them there, not losers!

Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER!
%
This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!
%
Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!
%
I WANT NOTHING!
%
Democrats' smear campaign is falling apart.
%
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the least productive Speaker of the House in history. 
%
The three year Hoax continues!
%
... in the end we will win and save our Country from certain destruction!
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they & Fake News Media are her BOSS)
%
This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media & their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi & Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!
%
Where is the Fake Whistleblower?
%
The Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats are turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. 
%
...see the just released ststement from Ukraine.
%
Paul, just concede the game, say I was right, and lets start a brand new game!
%
Schiff is a Corrupt Politician!
%
@SteveScalise blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show.
%
Paul Krugman has called me wrong from day one. People at the Failing New York Times are very angry at him for having “missed” by soooo much. Paul, match over!
%
The Do Nothing Dems are now doing even less - and soooo much work to be done!

Mr. Chairman [Kim Jong Un], Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a “rabid dog.” He is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!

They were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top and everybody knows it and now we're going to find out.

They must think we're nuts in this country.
%
Now, Adam Schiff is a sick puppy.
%
What you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal.
%
...the word is, it's historic, that's what the word is. That's what I hear. And if it's historic, you're going to see something.
%
I don't like to use the word 'deep state.' I just say they're really bad, sick people.
%
OK, the information that we have now is beyond belief already. But what they have coming out, I hear, is historic.
%
Call it anti-Trump people.
%
Joe Biden is corrupt.
%
Remember it was trending number one.
%
Rudy Giuliani was one of the great crime fighters of all time. He's also a friend of mine. He's a great person. He's like an iconic figure in this country for two reasons. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York and he was the greatest crime fighter probably in the last 50 years.
%
Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person. You know, I've -- I said, why are you being so kind? Well, sir, she's a woman, we have to be nice.
%
This was not an angel, this woman, OK? And there are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like and we will talk about that at some time.
%
I know a lot about stardom. I know a lot about it. I've made plenty of them.
%
I mean Adam Schiff is -- is a nut job.
%
Why did Shifty Schiff, a crooked politician, a corrupt politician. Why did he make up my statement?
%
I have to deal with crazy Nancy. She is crazy as a bedbug. She is nuts.
%
We have loopholes, they are called loopholes for a reason because they are loopholes.
%
I don't know if Joe can make it mentally. He is off, there is no question about it. So, I don't know if he's going to make it mentally. If he can get through it without cracking up, which is a real question, many people have asked it.

Kellyanne is great. She is married to a total whack job. She must have done number on him. I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy.
%
Well a lot of things are the matter with me.
%
We had the best year we ever had by far.
%
I don't recall. No, not at all. Not even a little bit. 
%
But to me, it's clean air and crystal-clean, clear water. And we have now the cleanest air we've ever had in our country, meaning over the last 40 years.

I had 35 people in my office -- farmers, and builders, and ranchers, and others. Strong people, very strong -- men and women -- and almost all of them were crying. They said, 'You've given our life back.'

My daughter Ivanka, that's all she wants to talk about. I say, 'Ivanka, can we please talk about something else?' 'No, Dad. I met today with Walmart.

They'd rule against us because they said, 'Hey, don't worry about the United States. They're the stupid people. Don't worry. Rule against them.'...Now, we're winning cases, because they really think that I'll do something very powerful, which we have the right to do. And they're right when they think that way.

And we have the greatest military force on Earth. It was depleted when I took over...We had a military that was so depleted, so bad...I could tell you stories about ammunition. They didn't have ammunition.

This is the first time, Secretary Azar, I think in 51 years, that prices have actually gone down...for prescription drugs. So, that's quite an achievement.

We [US and China] have a deal potentially, very close. He wants to make it much more than I want to make it I'm not anxious to make it
%
I think it's very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.
%
Support for Impeachment is dropping like a rock.
%
Yea, well that's total nonsense. I do want always corruption.
%
The radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart.
%
First it was the Russia hoax, total hoax. It was a failed overthrow attempt and the biggest fraud in the history of our country and then you look, the Mueller deal, you remember that mess? They had nothing.
%
Now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged impeachment -- think of this: Impeachment. Impeachment. A witch hunt. ... They're pushing that impeachment witch hunt and a lot of bad things are happening to them.
%
I would bring back waterboarding, and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.

Don't tell me it doesn't work. Torture works.

Half these guys [tell me] torture doesn't work. Believe me, it works.
%
Just this week I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state. You know what I'm talking about. And so many people said, 'Sir, I don't think you should do that.'
%
I never got the turkey. A gorgeous piece of turkey.
%
We flew 8331 miles to be here tonight for one simple reason, to tell you in person that this Thanksgiving is a special Thanksgiving. We’re doing so well. Our country is the strongest economically it’s ever been. We’ve never done so well. We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. So it is nice to know that you are fighting for something that is doing well as opposed to something that was not doing well just a number of years ago.
%
I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn't even be allowed.
%
Thank you to President Zelensky. Case over. The Do Nothing Democrats should finally go back to work!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only. The Failing New York Times thinks that is O.K., because their hatred & bias is so great they can’t even see straight. It’s not O.K.!
%
If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over!
%
I thought Newsweek was out of business?
%
I don't think [President Xi Jinping] likes me so much anymore.
%
That's the reason [Macron] is a great politician, because that was one of the greatest non-answers I've ever heard. And that's okay.
%
I never met him. I don't know who Putin is.
%
NATO is obsolete. It's old. It's fat. It's sloppy.
%
[Justin Trudeau] is two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy. But the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% and I guess he's not very happy about it.
%
I hate it. I meet these people they call them 'the elite.' These people. I look at them, I say, 'That's elite?' We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we're smarter than they are, and they say they're elite? We're the elite. You're the elite. We're the elite.
%
We have the most powerful military we've ever had and we're by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don't have to use it, but if we do, we'll use it. If we have to, we'll do it
%
Heading to a meeting now with those countries that have met their 2% GOALS, followed by meetings with Denmark and Italy....
%
That was funny when I said the guy's two-faced.
%
The world is laughing at us. We gotta make 'em stop.
%
The world is laughing at us. They're laughing at the stupidity of our president.
%
The world is laughing at us. They think we're stupid.
%
We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be.
%
Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment.
%
Well, I think it was fantastic. I think they have to end it now. He said there was no quid pro quo. 'The President did absolutely nothing wrong.'
%
Support for Impeachment is dropping like a rock, down into the 20's in some Polls.
%
...you have a Chelsea Manning who stole classified information and did many, many things that were not good and gets pardoned -- or whatever happened...
%
But if you read the crooked New York Times, if you read the Washington Post -- which is just a horrible paper... I want them to get correct news, not fake news, but they're bad people.
%
Hey, I look over, I say, 'There's nobody in that car, what's going on?'
%
Do you see what's happening in the polls? Everybody said, 'That's really bullshit.' Everybody.
%
Why isn't Germany putting up money? Why isn't France putting up money? Why isn't all of the European nations, why aren't they putting up?
%
I'm sorry, but we don't need help, we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody. Thank all of the European countries. They each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.
%
Even look at what I've done for Ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff. And Obama would send pillows and sheets. He wouldn't send anything else.
%
When I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone, you can read it. He didn't like her. He brought up her name and he didn't like her at all.
%
This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful, she wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. ... She's in charge of the embassy. She wouldn't hang it. It took like a year and a half, or two years, for her to get the picture up.
%
I was actually the man of the year in Michigan about 10 years before the election, if you can believe it. That was unrelated to politics, right.
%
We go out, we never have an empty seat.
%
The Democrats would not give me anything, any money, didn't matter -- billions and billions for anything except the wall.
%
Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn't care about American Workers!
%
The floors of the forests are filthy, dirty, meaning, feet of leaves and fallen timber. 
%
I was with the president of Finland and he said: ‘We have, much different, we are a forest nation.’ He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don’t have any problem.
%
I'm very happy with China right now. They're paying us billions and billions.
%
I'm helping people that need help because China is paying us tremendous. And they're paying for it. Those tariffs are not paid by us.
%
You know, if you look back, everybody said China was going to capture the United States in terms of the economy, it would surpass the United States within the second year of the presidency -- you know when I was running, they kept saying that.
%
If Crooked Hillary had won, China would now be the largest economy in the world. They were going to surpass us, expected to, in the second year of the presidency.
%
We've had the best year we've ever had by far.
%
I flew to Texas, the great State of Texas, and I opened up an Apple computer plant.
%
We ended the last administration's war on American energy.
%
I shouldn't do it, I shouldn't do it because we lose a small audience when that happens.
%
He really likes sending rockets up, doesn't he? That's why I call him Rocket Man.
%
If you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast.
%
We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.
%
Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she “prays for the President.” I don’t believe her, not even close.
%
Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?
%
The Democrats have gone crazy. And you know what? They have to be careful. Because when the shoe is on the other foot... And some day, hopefully in the very long distant future, you'll have a Democrat president, you'll have a Republican house, and they'll do the same thing because someone picked an orange out of the refrigerator and you don't like it, so let's go and impeach him.
%
We had a case where we had an African American guy who was a fan of mine. Great fan. Great guy! In fact, I want to find out what's going on with him. You know what I ... Oh, look at my African American over here. Look at him!
%
As far as witholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid.
%
You turn on the faucet and you don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out.
%
People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.
%
You go into a new building or a new house or a new home and they have standards only you don't get water. You can't wash your hands practically, there's so little water comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands.
%
There may be some areas where we'll go the other route -- desert areas -- but for the most part you have many states where they have so much water -- it comes down, it's called rain. They don't know what to do with it.
%
Being a vain person, that's really important to me. It gives you an orange look, I don't want an orange look.
%
Right now the cars are made out of papier-mache, and ours are actually, we allow steel content.
%
We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on -- and in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.
%
You love my hair? She knows what to say. She knows how to make me happy.
%
A lot of you are in the real estate business 'cos I know you very well. You're brutal killers. Not nice people at all. But you have to vote for him, you have no choice. You're not gonna vote for Pokahontas, I can tell you that.
%
Even if some of you don't like me. Some of you I don't like at all, actually. And you're gonna be my biggest supporters because you'll be out of business in about 15 minutes if they get in. So I don't have to spend a lot of time on that. 
%
So we'll count from 5 down to that very special number...
%
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding... extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!
%
Did you know anything about this? Did you have any role? Mohammed, I need to know. Was there a bone saw? Because if there was a bone saw, that changes everything. I mean, I've been in some pretty tough negotiations. I've never had to take a bone saw with me.
%
This is a huge problem. Where's the body? We've got to resolve this. We've got to get his body back to his family.
%
[to MBS re: Khashoggi killing] You know, we're sticking by you. This is an important relationship.
%
Everyone said this is impeachment-lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country, by far. It's not even like an impeachment.
%
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100.
%
I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany.
%
[Greta Thunberg] seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!
%
So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!
%
I also have constantly asked, “Why aren’t Germany, France and other European countries helping Ukraine more? They are the biggest beneficiaries. Why is it always the good ol’ United States?” The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, never mention this at their phony hearing!
%
ANTIFA will not be going after Bryce or @ColbyCovMMA anytime soon. They much prefer people who can’t fight back!

Dirty cops!

Very sad!

I will be there [Maralago] in two weeks, The Southern White House!
%
After years of rebuilding OTHER NATIONS, we are finally rebuilding OUR NATION. In everything we do, we are putting AMERICA FIRST!
%
I raised $530 Billion more from NATO countries!
%
They spied on my campaign!
%
It’s great to have a wonderful subject, President Trump. Fake News like CNN & MSNBC are dying. If they treated me fairly, they would do well. Have Zero credibility!
%
The News Media in our Country is FAKE and in many cases, totally CORRUPT!
%
Day after day, we are exposing the depravity, dishonesty and sickness of the corrupt Washington establishment — and with your help, we are going to complete the mission and DRAIN THE SWAMP!
%
I love Hershey chocolate!
%
To Impeach a President who has proven through results, including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country’s history, to have one of the most successful presidencies ever, and most importantly, who has done NOTHING wrong, is sheer Political Madness!
%
With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI.
%
Don't let the Impeachment Sham distract from the fact that the Obama FBI was just faulted for numerous "omissions" and "inaccuracies" in the IG Report.
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are a disgrace!
%
The best Economy ever!
%
AMERICA FIRST!
%
.CNN is a ratings disaster. Lost all credibility!
%
What he did is illegal. Schiff is a corrupt politician and a criminal!
%
The Wall is going up fast!
%
I got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more, and the U.S. less, and came home to a Fake News Media that mocked me. Didn’t think that was possible!
%
The Dems wouldn’t let @FoxNews get near their bad ratings debates, yet Fox panders. Pathetic!
%
Our Economy is the envy of the World!
%
While the world is not doing well economically, our Country is doing better, perhaps, than it has ever done before.
%
Why is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money, and if they don’t, they create it. STOP!
%
Without the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems!
%
Do not believe any article or story you read or see that uses “anonymous sources” having to do with trade or any other subject. Only accept information if it has an actual living name on it. The Fake News Media makes up many “sources say” stories. Do not believe them!
%
Where’s the Fake Whistleblower? Where’s Whistleblower number 2? Where’s the phony informer who got it all wrong?

Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit.
%
The Do Nothing, Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. 
%
I was elected to “Clean the Swamp.”
%
Proudly for our Country, no President has ever achieved so much in so little time.
%
Such a thing has never been done before!
%
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO.

No increase for U.S., only deep respect!

Oh that's a beautiful new hat. Look at the hat that guy's got on. How's that hat workin' out? Is that hat good? I love that hat.
%
I think that the whole impeachment thing... hoax... I guess you could call it a hoax, 'cos it is a hoax... Nancy Pelosi knows it... by the way, they duped her yesterday. 
%
[Impeachment] seems to be good for me politically.
%
I could show you numbers that people have never seen numbers like that before, so the impeachment is a hoax. It's a sham. It started a looong time ago. Probably before I came down the escalator with the future First Lady. 
%
Crooked Hillary... is as crooked as a three dollar bill.
%
I’ll do whatever I want.
%
We've ended the war on clean Pencilvanal...

Like we used to say in the military, make a path. Mark, I don't know how... come on. Come on up, Mark. He's so big. Right Mark? Come on over.

I'm a professional at technology.

When during the campaign I would say, 'Mexico's going to pay for it,' obviously I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check.
%
I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily.
%
The world is not doing well and we're going great.

By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German shepherd.

How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?

Yeah, Obama had a dog. You're right. Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration.
%
I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession, and we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.

I found some very old laws from when our country was rich. Really rich. The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off. You could hardly see, they were so dusty.

But can you imagine any of these people up here doing what I'm doing? They'd be 200 people show up if they were president. If they were president, nobody would show up.

%
I think I can say I really got to know [Queen Elizabeth] because I sat with her many times. And we had automatic chemistry. You understand that feeling.
%
I think [Pelosi is] a disgrace. I actually don't think she's a talented person. I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.
%
We have Pelosi, we have Crying Chuck Schumer, who's a disaster, by the way. He's a total political, you know, jerk.
%
There are those that say they have never seen the Queen have a better time, a more animated time.
%
Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money.
%
We are not fools anymore. We are not the foolish country that does so badly.

We are -- if you look at China, China, as great as they are and they are great, they are near the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in undershirts and they were not $2 billion a piece.
%
I have to tell you, [Biden is] a different guy. He looks different than he used to. He acts different than he used to. He's even slower than he used to be.

The crime was by the Democrats, folks. They've committed, in my opinion, many crimes.

I think [Biden is] the weakest, mentally. And I like running against people that are weak, mentally.

The farmers are my best friend.
