I have a great relationship with the blacks.

I will build a great wall -- and nobody bulds walls better than me, believe me -- and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great wall on our sothern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.

I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.

All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me--consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.

Before a show, I'll go backstage and everyon'es getting dressed, and everything else, and you now, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it... You know, they're standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.
%
They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the woment had become doctors. And I wasn't interested.
%
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
%
I'm [the Democrats'] worst nightmare.
%
[Ariana Huffington] is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man -- he made a good decision.
%
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, they're  sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.
%
My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well been documented, are various other parts of my body.
%
I take advantage of the laws of the nation. Because I'm running a company.

Our great African American president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.

%
I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. The total is $8,737,540,000 USD. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag.

I'm not a schmuck. Even if the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, I wn't lose a penny.
%
What is it at 35 [years of age]? It's called check-out time.":
%
No, I have no age -- I mean, I have age limit. I don't want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know, 12 year olds.
%
i would say I'm the best all-time judge. Don't forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.
%
I know nothing about the inter-workings of Russia.

[Not paying federal income taxes] makes me smart!

Some people have an ability to negotiate. It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
%
It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway. 
%
Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so.

I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist.
%
I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.
%
People think I'm a gambler. I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines. It's a very good business being the house.
%
I'm a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision.
%
You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.
%
In my life, there are two things I've found I'm very good at: overcoming obstacles and motivating good people to do their best work.
%
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
%
I'm gonna be dating her [a 10 year old girl] in ten years.
%
I'm conservative, and even very conservative. But I'm quite liberal and getting much more liberal on health care and other things. I really say: What's the purpose of a country if you're not going to have defensive and health care? If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. I mean, it's no good. So I'm very liberal when it comes to health care. I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.
%
People want me to [run for president] all the time … I don’t like it. Can you imagine how controversial I’d be? You think about [Bill Clinton] and the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine?
%
I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.
%
So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.

It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.

I love beautiful women, and beautiful women love me. It has to be both ways.

Watch, listen, and learn. You can't know it all yourself—anyone who thinks that they do is destined for mediocrity.
%
I don't like firing people. It's not a pleasant thing and it's sad.
%
["You're Fired!"] There's a beauty in those two words. When you utter those words, there's very little that can be said. There's a succinctness to those words.
%
I thought today’s women were independent and had a lot of sexual freedom. ... Well, I guess they fooled me.
%
I sort of hope [a housing crash] happens because then people like me would go in and buy.
%
26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?

If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?

There is a way of beating ISIS so easily, so quickly, so effectively, and it would be so nice...I know a way that would absolutely give us guaranteed victory...the problem is then everybody will take the idea, run with it and then people will forget where it came from...I ran it past two or three people. [It's] so simple. It's like the paper clip.
%
I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know why he wouldn't release his records.

He's not a war hero... He's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you.
%
If you can't get rich dealing with politicians, there's something wrong with you.
%
I think that I would be a great uniter. I think that I would have great diplomatic skills. I think that I would be able to get along with people very well. I've had a great success in my life. I think the world would unite if I were the leader of the United States.
%
Look at that face! [of Carly Fiorina] Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?
%
This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.

Why aren’t we letting ISIS go and fight Assad and then we pick up the remnants?
%
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on...
%
We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice.

I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. 
%
I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters. It's like incredible. No, they say, "Trump we love you too." 
%
But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall.
%
Torture works, okay folks?
%
I love the poorly educated.
%
I promise you, I will not be taking very long vacations, if I take them at all. There’s no time for vacations. We’re not going to be big on vacations.
%
I can be presidential, but if I was presidential I would only have - about 20% of you would be here because it would be boring as hell.
%
I love working. I’m not a vacation guy. Right? Like Obama, he plays golf in Hawaii. He flies in a 747.
%
If you love what you do, you’re happy. You don’t take vacations.
%

u've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care.

%
Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
%
The things that were said about me. … You know what, I wanted to hit a couple of those speakers so hard. ... I was gonna hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was gonna hit this guy so hard, his head would spin. He wouldn't know what the hell happened.
%
Putin said I was a genius.
%
I think [Anthony Weiner is] a pervert. It’s dangerous to allow him on the convention floor.
%
There will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
%
 I have one of the great temperaments. I have a winning temperament.
%
I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him.
%
The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.
%
President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!

Don’t worry about that baby. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. 
%
I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf.
%
I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician.
%
We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "confidential" or "classified".
%
For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans. How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?
%
Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.
%
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
%
We have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
%
Honestly, she should be locked up. She should be. Should be locked up.
%
Believe me: She [one of the women accusing him of sexual assault] would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.
%
Such a nasty woman. 
%
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win.
%
And I have to give the FBI credit, that was so bad, what happened, originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made, in light of the kind of opposition he had, with their trying to protect her from criminal prosecution, you know that.
%
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
%
Drain the Swamp
%
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
%
I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now.
%
I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious...
%
And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. 
%
Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind.
%
I don’t care about my company. ... Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country.
%
To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people.
%
The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel.
%
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
%
I've always felt the need to pray...I would say that the office is so powerful that you need God even more.
%
For us here in Washington, we must never ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to His will.
But we had tremendous success on The Apprentice and, when I ran for President, I had to leave the show, that's when I knew for sure I was doing it, and they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes, it's been a total disaster, and Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those rating, OK?
%
Who is the state senator? Do you want to give me his name? We'll destroy his career.
%
As far as people, Jewish people, so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren...
%
I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
%
This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.
%
You know what uranium is, right? It's a thing called nuclear weapons and other things like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.
%
Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.
%
So what happens is, I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq. [Interviewer interrupts to correct him] Yes, heading toward Syria.
%
So this is promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America. And, now, there’s a lot of words I won’t bother reading everything.
%
I think we've done more than perhaps any president in the first 100 days.... Not since [President] Harry Truman has anybody done so much.
%
I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job.
%
I'm not under investigation.

Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm fucked.

Despite the constant negative press covfefe

History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters.

I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions I just don't want a poor person.

We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, so it creates energy, and pays for itself. And this way Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good, right, is that good?
%
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
%
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!
%
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
%
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John.
%
I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I’m in front of the boy scouts, right?
%
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?
%
North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. 
%
I think there's blame on both sides, you look at, you look at both sides, I think there's blame on both side, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.
%
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented. It's that socialism has been faithfully implemented.
%
The media is — really, the word, I think one of the greatest of all terms I’ve come up with is "fake". I guess other people have used it, perhaps, over the years, but I’ve never noticed it.
%
Now some people might call him the King of China, but he's called President.
%
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
%
Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart...
%
Right now, in a number of states, the laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the ninth month. It is wrong, it has to change.
%
Because in America people don't worship government. They worship God.
%
We have to do it gently because we’re in the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very gentle. We will very gently take that kit, and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t hit her and injure her arm.
%
The border with the Sahara can't be bigger than ours with Mexico.
%
When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!
%
This is a tough hurricane. One of the wettest we've ever seen from a standpoint of water.
%
You know they have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned, it's called a nationalist  And I say 'really, we're not supposed to use that word?' Do you know what I am? I'm a nationalist.
%
Now how ridiculous: we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits
%
Right now, we're at the cleanest we've ever been, and that's very important to me. But if we're clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so goodA
%
One of the problems that a lot of people like myself we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. 
%
I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I won't blame you for it. The last time, you shut it down. It didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down.

We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith
%
In fact, I think I can say this, Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. He said: "I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize." I said, 'Thank you.'
%
Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan, and they had alarms going off — you know that. Now all of the sudden they feel good, they feel safe. I did that.
%
There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no crime.
%
The kidney has a very special place in the heart.

Why do we want all these people from shithole countries coming here?

Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.

Name one country run by a black person that's not a shithole... Name one city.

Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico is making a fortune. off the United states. Mixico's gonna pay for the wall, and they're gonna be happy about it.

That's central casting, You can't cast -- you don't have anybody in Hollywood that looks like these guys.
%
So you'll be a movie star, the way you look.
%
These guys are central casting -- like from a movie, except better. They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better-looking in a certain way.
%
Look at them. Central casting. There's no Hollywood set where you could produce people that look like them.

He's got 10 people standing behind him. Every one is central casting. Central casting. Glasses, pad...

...the question you have to ask is 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' because Epstein had an island that was not a good place as I understand it, and I was never there. So you have to ask, 'Did Bill Clinton go to the island?' If you find that out, you're going to know a lot.

I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.

No President has done what I've done.

In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that.

I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.

Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it.
%
Nobody has done a job like I've done.

We're building tremendous numbers of miles of wall right now in different locations. It all comes together likes a beautiful puzzle.

I am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person.

In six years, when I'm not here, The New York Times goes out of business very quickly.
%
We wiped out the caliphate, 100%. I did in record time.

So when I went to Dayton, and when I went to El Paso, and I went into those hospitals, the love for me -- and me, maybe, as a representative of the country -- but for me -- and my love for them was unparalleled.

It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.

Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.
%
My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?
%
We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.
%
We have a series of magnificent buildings; we call them bungalows.

I don't do things for political reasons.

I do nothing for politics. I know a lot of you aren't going to -- you're going to smile at that. I do nothing for politics.

Russia has its submarine -- that's where they do their submarine work, and that's where they dock large and powerful submarines.
%
I have a lot of feeling for President Xi. He's very outstanding in so many ways.
%
I love the UK. I own great property in the UK. I love the UK. I have no idea how my property is doing because I don't care. But I own Turnberry, and I own in Aberdeen, and I own in Ireland, as you know -- Doonbeg -- and great stuff.
%
And I'm an environmentalist. A lot of people don't understand that. I have done more environmental impact statements, probably, than anybody that's -- I guess I can say definitely, because I have done many, many, many of them.

And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!

[Fox] should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win. Too Bad!

There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt!
%
[Fox] isn't working for us anymore! ... We have to start looking for a new News Outlet.
%
When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!

Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!

...we have a Fed problem. They don’t have a clue!

Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.
%
Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president, and there are no consequences.
%
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. 
%
Witch hunt!
%
[William Barr is] one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!
%
I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them? They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?

I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!

 I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I've seen some Category 4's -- you don't even see them that much. (re: Hurricane Dorian)

The incompetent Mayor of London, Sadique (sic) Kahn, was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday.

Kahn... is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!

Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!

Absolutely worth it, we don’t want to be servants to the Chinese!

We are winning again, and we are respected again!

Being scolded by failed former “Intelligence” officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don’t have a clue. They really set our Country back,....

Kim Jong Un -- who I've gotten to know extremely well; the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me -- he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.

I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I've made that wealth come alive.

I want clean air and clean water. And we're, right now, having the cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.

Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue?

Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!

Kim Jong Un has been, you know, pretty straight with me, I think

These are great women. I see them so much and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me.

By the way we're building that wall and it's going up very big.

But it's my hair. May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot.
%
You don't have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now.
%
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. They're socialists.
%
In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or than we promised, so many more. So many more. So many more.
%
I love budgets and we'll get to that. Don't worry about it but we had to rebuild.
%
A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.
%
So in 2016, we had in my opinion, the greatest phrase in the history of politics. Make America Great Again.
%
I've gotten extremely cautious.
%
Under the normal rules, I'll be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term.
%
I'm not a vain person.

She beat a man that likes flamingo dancers from Argentina. He was supposed to be vacationing on the Tallahassee trail, but he was actually in Argentina.

The Tallahassee Trail — must be a beautiful place. Unfortunately, he didn't go there.

We have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out.
%
We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being born very much by us. They're eating the cost.

The bulb that we're being forced to use, number one most importantly the light's no good -- I always look orange. And so do you -- the light is the worst.
%
No more cows, no more planes. I guess no more people, right. Because Kevin is just like a cow, he's just smaller.
%
They're standing behind AOC. I call her Cortez because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just go Cortez. They don't like that when you call her Cortez. But her name's Cortez, too -- too long.
%
Can you imagine those two guys in a room. Here's Xi and here's Sleepy Joe, what. Where am I? Where am I? Just sign here Sleepy Joe, just sign here.

Because one thing I've learned about politics, you can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying and then about two weeks later say the exact opposite and nobody will ever even call you on it.

Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise, they kill all the birds.
%
...is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? ... I'll be able to figure it out!
%
It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you got to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.
%
Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the $100 trillion Green New Deal. That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right?
%
Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy ... if you look at what's going on, your way of life is under assault by these people.
%
Democrats also believe any illegal alien who merely sets foot on US soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free health care for life.
%
I never did that. I never did that. That's a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida, and they talk about Alabama. That's just fake news. It was, right from the beginning, it was a fake story.
%
Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. ...The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.'
%
The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills — I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China...

By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country.

By the way, China is having the worst year they've had now in 57 years, okay? Fifty-seven. It was 27. It was 22 and then 27. It's 57 years. This is the worst year they've had.

...I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA.

I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.

We can’t have our youth be so affected, and I’m hearing it, and that’s how the First Lady got involved. She’s got a son, together, that’s a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it.

We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption.

If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.

You're talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tarrifs, okay?
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!
%
Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!
%
This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!
%
I can do it very easily, but I'd rather not do it from the standpoint of all of the other conversations I have. I may do it, 'cause it was a very innocent call.

I think I'll get a Nobel prize for a lot of things. If they give it out fairly, which they don't.

How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been, Cut Record Taxes & Regulations, fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years), & so much more?...

Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!

To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff. Low ratings CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!

So many lies by Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats!

I always cooperate

The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306. Get a better candidate this time, you'll need it!

We have breaking news. Trump exaggerated.

Didn't you hear — Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all — it was all over the place. I don't know — they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, 'We can't...' Essentially, he said, 'We can't beat him. Let's impeach him.' That's pretty — that's pretty dangerous stuff.

We got Choice approved. It couldn't be approved.

They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego. As soon as it was completed, they said, 'We don't want a wall.' They were begging me for a wall. I should take it out and move it to another location.

You are making me look like an idiot!

Well, why don't we just shoot [Mexican immigrants] in the leg? That'll slow them down.

We don’t call him shifty Schiff for nothing. He’s a shifty, dishonest guy.

Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the second amendment [the right to have a gun]. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.

His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably ... maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. But plenty of people have written that. She was extremely quiet. And it looked like she had nothing to say. (Said of a woman whose husband had just been killed in a bombing.)

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

My wife says I'm the biggest star in the world. But she might just be saying that because she's intelligent.

The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It's not a friend to freedom. It's not a friend even to the United States of America, where as all know, it has its home. And it surely isn’t a friend to Israel.

I have to start by saying I'm a big fan, a very big fan, of the United Nations and all it stands for... the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world, as far as I am concerned. So I am a big fan.

I don’t know, all I know is what’s on the internet.

It's certainly not groundbreaking news that the early victories by the women on 'The Apprentice' were, to a very large extent, dependent on their sex appeal.

You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.

It's like in golf... A lot of people - I don't want this to sound trivial - but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive... it's weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can't sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.

I have a great relationship with African Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them.

The line of 'Make America great again,' the phrase, that was mine, I came up with it about a year ago, and I kept using it, and everybody's using it, they are all loving it. I don't know, I guess I should copyright it, maybe I have copyrighted it.

If you look at Saddam Hussein, he killed terrorists. I'm not saying he was an angel, but this guy killed terrorists.

Jeb said, 'we were safe with my brother. We were safe.' Well, the World Trade Center just fell down! Now, am I trying to blame him? I'm not blaming anybody. But the World Trade Center came down. So when he said, we were safe, that's not safe.

I never attacked [Rand Paul] on his looks, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.

I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney - I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney.
%
[John McCain is]... not a war hero. He's a war hero - he's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I Like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you.

My favourite part [of Pulp Fiction] is when Sam has his gun out in the diner and he tells the guy to tell his girlfriend to shut up. 'Tell that bitch to be cool. Say: Bitch be cool.' I love those lines.

As a kid, I was making a building with blocks in our playroom. I didn't have enough. So I asked my younger brother Robert if I could borrow some of his. He said, 'Okay, but you have to give them back when you're done.' I used all of my blocks, then all of his blocks, and when I was done I had a great building, which I then glued together. Robert never did get those blocks back.

I'd be a pretty good reporter.

I really believe they're going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.

I would never suggest this, but I will tell you, they're so lucky that we're peaceful

So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell-- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.
%
Does anybody really believe [Biden] is mentally fit to be President?
%
Never has the press been more inaccurate, unfair or corrupt! We are not fighting the Democrats, they are easy, we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media. They have gone totally CRAZY.
%
Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.
%
Much of it is corrupt. It's corrupt. You have corrupt media in this country. And it truly is the enemy of the people.
%
I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden - I just don’t think it’s going to happen. Sleepy Joe won’t get to the starting gate, & based on all of the money he & his family probably “extorted,” Joe should hang it up. I wouldn’t want him dealing with China & U!
%
It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter
%
The Democrats are lucky that they don’t have any Mitt Romney types. They may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are being exposed!
%
The great Scam is being revealed!
%
...another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!
%
Schiff and the Do Nothing Dems have lost all credibility...but the corrupt Media is working hard to keep them in the game!
%
LYIN’ SHIFTY SCHIFF!
%
I’m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY
%
Not only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election, but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!
%
"Schiff is a FRAUD!"
%
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous “ass” who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!
%
The Media is “Fixed” and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The 
@nytimes & @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!
%
Schiff has also committed a crime, perhaps treason
%
He is a sick puppy!
%
Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).
%
We are simultaneously fighting the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party. Always tough to beat the “Press,” but people are beginning to see how totally CORRUPT they are, and it makes our job a whole lot easier!
%
AOC is a Wack Job!
%
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
%
ELECTION INTERFERENCE!
%
Leader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don’t have a chance!
%
Fake News, just like the snakes and gators in the moat. The Media is deranged, they have lost their minds!
%
Schiff is a lying disaster for our Country. He should resign!
%
As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!).
%
THE USA IS GREAT!
%
Hasn’t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?
%
I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena!
%
Adam should be Impeached!
%
The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!
%
We defeated the caliphate 100 percent, and now it’s time for Germany and France, and all of the nations where they came from, to take them back.  And they chose no.  And maybe they’ll — maybe they’re going to change their tune now.  I don’t know.
%
One poll had me up 12 points, 16 points, or 17 points.
%
Look, we beat you on the — we won on the Mueller scam.
%
This is the most ridiculous thing many people have ever seen.
%
We win.
%
The head is — that’s — it doesn’t get any bigger in your world.
%
We’re doing things I think that nobody thought was possible.
%
Perhaps there’ll be some changes made, and perhaps not.  But we have to be respected as a nation.
%
You have some very, very wealthy nations, extremely wealthy nations, where we take care of their military and we take care of their military needs.  Nobody can do it better than us.
%
We’ll see what happens with respect to a lot of different things.
%
Got to treat them good, and you got to take care of ISIS.
%
Turkey has been fighting them for many years.  Somebody said hundreds of years.  You had just mentioned to me yesterday, 200 years, maybe more.
%
People understand that it’s a fraud.  It’s a scam.  It’s a witch hunt.  And all we do is just keep fighting for the American people, because that’s all I do.
%
Harvey, as far as I’m concerned — the big hurricane from a year ago in Texas, which was, I guess, they say, the biggest dump of water we’ve ever had in this country, and probably so.
%
We spent a trillion and a half dollars, so at least you should get some helicopters out of it, right?
%
China is coming along well.  I actually think that tremendous progress was made over the last little while with respect to the question you just asked, having to do with Iran. So we’ll see.  We’ll see.  But it’s all going to work out — always does.  We get it to work out.  And if it doesn’t, sometimes it takes a little longer.  But I get things to work out...
%
We’re going to be doing money.  We’re going to be doing a lot of things.  We helped the state of Texas.
%
You would have been talking about anywhere from 10- to 20- or even 25,000 lives would have been lost.  So the Coast Guard has really done a job.
%
Last time, I came a few days later, and some of the areas were already — you see people out there cutting their lawn.  They had five feet of water on top of their lawn and they’re cutting their lawn a short time later.
%
Nobody has reacted to hurricanes and flooding like the Trump administration.  And nobody has helped Texas like the Trump administration has helped. 
%
You know, you never know.
%
It was the biggest election victory in India for, at a minimum, a very long time.  I think — from the beginning.  That’s a long time.
%
I would love to do whatever I want to do.  I’d love to do it.  But you have to be a little bit shy about doing that.
%
Well, we’re looking at — we’re looking at that.  You know, people don’t like that, and I don’t like it — the concept of it.  But we’re looking at it.  It’s perfect.
%
I’m not looking to hurt him because he’s got his own difficulties.
%
We don’t want a country that we’re giving massive aid to to be corrupting our system.  And we don’t want it to be corrupted in any way, but we certainly don’t want it to be corrupting our system.
%
So, we don’t want to let anything having to do with any of that really, you know, hurt our country.  So it would be fine to do it, but you will see one of the finest, one of the nicest — if we do that.  Or I’ll have somebody — I’ll give it to a respected source.  They can look at it.
%
whoever [FOX's] Pollster is, they suck.
%
It’s so different than it used to be. Oh well, I’m President!
%
Minneapolis, you have a rotten mayor. She's either really stupid, okay? Or she's really lost it. Maybe there's a little dishonesty in there someplace.
%
Hunter. You are a loser. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. 
%
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous "ass"
%
They know they can’t win on Election Day so they’re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bullshit impeachment!
%
Tomorrow, you’ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out.
%
LOUISIANA — Tomorrow, you will head to the polls and VOTE to REPLACE Liberal Democrat John Bel Edwards with a great new REPUBLICAN Governor! 
%
Is [Shepard Smith] leaving [FOX] due to bad ratings, or some other less important reason?
%
Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days.
%
Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?
%
I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS.
%
Where is Hunter Biden? He has disappeared while the Fake News protects his Crooked daddy!
%
You know how many cases I've lost and then we win?
%
Impeachment. I never thought I'd see or hear that word with regard to me. Impeachment. I said the other day it's an ugly word. To me, it's an ugly word. Very ugly word. It means so much. It means horrible, horrible crimes and things, I can't even believe it. It's a witch hunt.
%
You know, if you want to go out and buy groceries, you need identification. If you want to do almost anything you need identification. The only thing you don't need identification for is to vote, the most important single thing you're doing -- to vote. You know why? Because they cheat like hell, that's why.
%
The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country.
%
Vote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us!
%
Never ending wars will end!
%
CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS & RANCHERS!
%
We have become a far greater Economic Power than ever before, and we are using that power for WORLD PEACE!
%
Where’s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.
%
Don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!
%
The Endless Wars Must End!
%
Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. 
%
The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out.
%
We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!
%
Schiff is a lying mess!
%
I’m not a fan of Jeb Bush. Because Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core, and he’s weak on immigration. Those are two bad things.

[Gov. Rick Perry] put on glasses so people think he’s smart. People can see through the glasses.

[Lindsay Graham's phone number] Give it a shot. “He won’t fix anything, but at least he’ll talk to you.

Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court, don't worry about it.

America First!

Now that we have found out that @CNN is a virtual fraud, rumor has it that Jeff Zucker will be resigining momentarily?

Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA. Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33,000 deleted Emails, not recoverable!

Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER, EVER, EVER! How about saying it this way, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!
%
Look, we have no soldiers in Syria. We've won. We've beat ISIS. And we've beat them badly and decisively. We have no soldiers [there were 1000 troops in Syria]
%
But even if you listen to the very good conversation that I had, a very, very good, no-pressure, congenial conversation with the new president of Ukraine, he had some things that were not flattering to say about her. And that came out of the blue. [the transcripts show Trunp brought it up]
%
Nancy Pelosi said, 'Well, that's what he said. Isn't it?' But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, 'Wait a minute, that's not what I was told.' But she was stuck, she was stuck. [entirely made up]
%
've strengthened the military to a point where it's never been. The military was so depleted, we were close to not having a military.
%
When I came into office, a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone. He said, 'Sir, we have no ammunition.'
%
When I came in, we had no ammunition two and a half years ago.
%
You know what the 'delinquent' means? That's an old real estate term. 'He's delinquent with his rent.' They're delinquent with their payment. They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back.
%
They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back. Because if Germany doesn't pay -- they don't add that up, they just say, 'Oh, that's okay.' Then they don't pay. And yet, they're -- if you go back that way, like the old fashioned way -- like you don't pay and you owe it. But they don't pay and they just go on to the next year. They owe us hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.
%
You know, Oprah used to be a very good friend of mine.
%
They believe in open borders, where anybody can come into our country -- anybody.
%
Most of the Democrats, four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden they don't want a wall. You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it.
%
And we built and we're building a wall, and it is going up rapidly. And that is tough because I built it against every single Democrat who, four years ago, wanted it. And the only reason they don't want it now is because I want it. It's the only reason. Only one reason.
%
You go out to California, you see what's happening out there? It's a disgrace. The voter abuse, it's a disgrace what's happening in California.
%
You have people out there -- they don't get it. They don't get it. So we love the Republicans.
%
The New Green Deal or Green New Deal. You can say it either way, by the way. It doesn't matter; same thing. It doesn't matter. Somebody said, 'Which comes first?' I said, 'It doesn't make any difference. They're both crazy.' No cows, no planes, no people, no energy, no oil, no gas -- no nothing.
%
Democrats also continue to encourage foreign interference in our elections by refusing to support a simple and beautiful thing called voter ID.
%
We have no inflation.
%
Usually, when a President comes to office, there's no — you have no vacancies. Or the previous President would have — boom.
%
You go back and check it out, you'll find that others left none, usually none — or one or two — but one, none. One hundred and forty-two.
%
President Obama was not very good at getting it done, because, you know, people held him up and everything else. But, with time, you get them all done. You get them done.
%
Our vets are happy now. We got them Choice. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]
%
We approved something called Veterans Choice. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]
%
We got Choice for the vets. [It was actually Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and John McCain. Oops!]
%
Energy, look, we're now the number one energy producer in the world, oil and gas. We weren't close when I got elected. [Actually, that's been the case since 2012]
%
We've ended the war on American energy and with your help, right here in Louisiana, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet. [Actually it has been since 2012]
%
You know, I was here a couple of months ago and they opened the biggest LNG plant I have ever seen in my life. Right? Were you there? And they've been trying to get this thing approved for years and years and years and they couldn't. And then President Trump came along and I got those permits so fast for them. These big energy executives were sitting back and they couldn't get it approved. Nothing they could do, would get it approved. Your governor was lousy, they were all lousy. Nobody could help. That thing was so dead, and I came along and I got it approved . [Actually, Obama did that, and the Cameron LNG website says as much.]
%
The New York Times basically has given up journalistic standards. They've said, 'We don't care; we'll say anything.' Essentially, they're just making up stories.

We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job.

Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server.

The whistleblower's report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn't know what he was talking about or was given false information or was even worse than that.
%
If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets.
%
It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing.
%
There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does.
%
Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new. [There isn't anything new or updated as of yet.]

[Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] is the world’s most overrated general.

I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.

Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her “upstairs,” or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!

House Democrats are engaged in “Soviet style” tactics in their effort to attack 
@realDonaldTrump

I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned.
%
The Do Nothing Democrats, Pelosi and Schumer stormed out of the Cabinet Room!

I’m fighting for the American people, but the Democrats’ sole focus is fighting against ME with their fraudulent Witch Hunt.
%
Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency!
%
Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!
%
Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!

Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand that they can play with.

[In letter to Ukraine President Erdogan] Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy--and I will.

If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.

I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call.
%
No one got people in the rallies as big as I did.
%
It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.
%
On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, ‘Mexico will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.
%
I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.
%
I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now.
%
This deal will make me look terrible.
%
O.K., this shows me to be a dope.
%
Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.
%
Russia hates ISIS. Russia hates ISIS as much as the United States does. Russia had a plane blown up by ISIS. Russia wants nothing to do with ISIS. Russia's tough, they can kill ISIS just as well, and they happen to be in their neighborhood.

Never give up. We are doing GREAT! We are WINNING!

...based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.
%
I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. 
%
...as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!
%
Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL, this time from @FoxNews, of course!

There has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt.

Such a disgrace that the Do Nothing Democrats are doing just as their name suggests, Doing Nothing! USMCA anyone?

Susan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria.

Can you believe I am doing this important work for our Country, and have to deal with Corrupt Adam Schiff and the Do Nothing Democrats at the same time? It was not intended to be this way for a President!
%
The USA!

Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption.

Tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party, the Fake News Media, and the rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State.

The radical left tolerates no dissent, it permits no opposition, it accepts no compromise, and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American People.

As the Witch Hunt continues!

The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!

FAKE NEWS!
%
Doral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats & their Partner, the Fake News Media! I’m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary! We’ll find someplace else!

All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!

The “Squad” (AOC Plus 3) and other Dems suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Crazy!

The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.

I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country... They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak & insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!

[Rep. Tlaib] hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!
%
Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!
%
[Tlaib] obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.
%
[Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib] hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds.
%
[Rep. Omar] is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!

Dems have such disdain for Israel!
%
Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep.
%
So funny to watch Schumer groveling. 
%
We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!
%
Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!
%
Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party.
%
Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party.
%
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party.

If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical “oversight” is a joke!

And we're building a wall on the border of New Mexico and we're building a wall in Colorado, we're building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works that you can't get over, you can't get under and we're building a wall in Texas. We're not building a wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the walls we just mentioned.
%
(Kiddingly) We're building a Wall in Colorado' (then stated, 'we're not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we're building on the Border') referred to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!.

They don't know who they're dealing with. They just don't understand. Alright, go home to mum. Explain to mom you tried to take on very powerful people. And many of them mentally as well as physically. That's not a good thing to do in this room... Make sure you don't hurt them. Please!!!

Just a continuation of the Witch Hunt!

It would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothinepublican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don’t know), in testimony before Congress! Do Nothing Democrats allow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency....
%
The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!

Where’s the Whistleblower?

Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!

It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!

The Democrats Scam goes on and on! They Do Nothing!

China's 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years.

China has had the worst year they've had in 27 years. And a lot of people are saying the worst year they've had in 54 years. OK?
%
[China is] having the worst year they've had, I understand, in 61 years.

China has now had the worst year that they've had in 57 years.

The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!
%
....  [8:18 AM · Oct 26, 2019 tweet... another covfefe?]
%
The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it.
%
We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city [San Francisco] rots away.
%
Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!
%
The Democrats must end this Scam now. Witch Hunt!
%
Thank you @foxandfriends! Hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason. You will never learn this from the corrupt LameStream Media who get Pulitzer Prizes for reporting the story totally wrong.
%
The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe!
%
My lawyers should sue the Democrats and Shifty Adam Schiff for fraud!
%
Under this administration, the great betrayal of the American worker is over.
%
My goal has been to give a voice to the voiceless.
%
Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!
%
Thank you Dan. That looks like Cary Grant, doesn't he? Have you ever been told that, Dan? It's not a bad compliment, I must say. Today we have... Tomon... Arnold. And in those days you had it a little different. Those days you had Errol Flynn, Cary Grant. A little different. 
%
That's what I did best. I built good.
%
By the way, you'll never have another president like me.
%
We're building a wall in Colorado. We're building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works!
%
...Hamza bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama bin Laden, who was saying very bad things about people...
%
I don't want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect -- as though you were watching a movie. It was -- that -- that in -- the technology there alone is -- is really great.
%
... they were shot from the air ships.
%
You know, they [ISIS] use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump.
%
This is an island surrounded by water, big water, ocean water.
%
[Hamza bin Laden] was talking bad things just like his father.
%
To this day, I get people coming up to me. They said, 'You know what one of the most amazing things I've ever seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.' It's true. Now, most of the press doesn't want to write that, but, you know -- but it's true. If you go back, look at my book. [It doesn't...]
%
Then you have the case of this wise guy, Jussie Smollett who beat up himself. And he said MAGA country did it -- MAGA country ... That's a hate crime and it's a scam. It's a real big scam just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.
%
I have to say this, he hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I've never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you.
%
Ladies and gentlemen of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here. ... I will leave now because I am boring you to death.
%
Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldn’t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
%
He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Thank you.
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!
%
Economy Rocks!
%
I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?
%
Where’s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!
%
Ukrain said NO PRESSURE.
%
Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!
%
That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!
%
Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!?
%
Don’t worry J.J., Schiff is a leaker & corrupt politician who made up what I said on the call in order to hurt the Republican Party & me!
%
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?
%
Please stop the Dems from hurting a very good and hard-working man!
%
The Dems are a lost cause. In 2020, we need a big, beautiful WIN
%
Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the 'informant?'
%
They don't talk about [the call with the Ukrane President] anymore. They don't like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect.
%
So, Conor Lamb -- right here from Pittsburgh. And I appreciate -- Conor, whoever you are -- I have no idea what you even look like. But there's some guy named Conor Lamb who speaks very nicely about -- you know why? Because you're in like a Trump district. No, it's right. It's true. Right? 'No, the President is excellent. He's doing a good job.' I thought he was a Republican until I found out.
%
They want to take away your guns. Conor Lamb wants to take away your guns.
%
But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president.
%
I'm sure you've heard the statement, because I made it more than any human being alive.
%
I don't get any credit for this, but that's OK. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book -- a, really, very successful book.
%
So, if I weren't elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now -- they were expecting around the second year of this term.
%
We are much bigger than the China economy. And we're getting bigger, and they're not.
%
I wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of -- of Syria and knocked out a whole base...
%
The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!
%
Miami International --one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it's the biggest. But one of the biggest airports in the world.
%
...you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause...
%
The New York Times wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they're saying well, it wasn't really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly.
%
There was no anything asked for. There was no pressure whatsoever.
%
You know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they're angels. OK?
%
Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!
%
But he made it sound so horrible. That's illegal. I mean, it -- no way you can get away with that. That's a -- but that's a total fraud.
%
They didn't even know what we were talking about. To think that they're using that -- now they don't talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good. So they don't talk about it anymore...
%
China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out.
%
I was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium -- I don't know, it's got to be an arena that's got to be 20 years old ... we have a record.
%
I go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record.
%
I haven't had an empty seat at a rally.
%
Look, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime.
%
Their policies are horrible: open borders, sanctuary cities, take everyone's guns away.
%
I fought off the Mueller hoax. I fought off all of them, and it continues. It's just crazy. This has never happened to a president before.
%
The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!
%
The Impeachment Hoax is hurting our Stock Market. The Do Nothing Democrats don’t care!
%
China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway.
%
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats have gone Crazy. Very bad for USA!
%
Democrats are "vicious" but are better at remaining united.
%
The case is very simple. It's quick. It's so quick.
%
Republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now  are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process.
%
This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax.
%
This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected. Rupublicans, go with Substance and close it out!
%
I met him when I was over when I was at an incredible... We had something that was so incredible. Now that was months ago, how time flies.
%
...despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse. 
%
At some point, I'm going to sit down, perhaps as a fireside chat on live television, and I will read the transcript of the call, because people have to hear it.
%
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
%
Their light just went off. See? Look. Their light was on -- they just turned it off!
%
I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.
%
You're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls. You're read... Let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.
%
You are sooo lucky to have me as your President (just kidding!). 
%
 It is a phony scam by the Do Nothing Dems!
%
If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these... monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!
%
When's he getting off the floor, Jim? The guy's a pain in the ass.
%
‘Could you call the head of some company in Japan, please?’ I say, ‘Matt, do I have to?’ ‘Please, please.’ But isn’t that what you really want in a governor? That’s what you want. He’s such a pain in the ass, but that’s what you want.”
%
Are you talking to me???
%
If you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. And if you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me!
%
Is there any place you'd rather be than at a Trump rally on a beautiful wonderful evening in Louisiana?
%
I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?
%
With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut.
%
Don't forget in 2016, people came from the mountains and the valleys, and the rivers and the oceans. They came from all over. The democrats said, "What the hell is happening? Where are all these people coming from?"
%
The testimony has been fine.
%
The call was perfect. Now they're after a second call which nobody knew about and I guess they want that call to be produced also. So I have a second call I have with the president, which actually I believe came before this one. And now they all want that one. And if they want it, I'll give it to them.
%
We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!
%
Well, they shouldn't be having public hearings. This is a hoax. This is just like the Russian witch hunt. This is just a continuation.
%
Be quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.
%
Well, now, you've really shaped my behavior, because from the day I came in here, I've had problems with phony stuff, like a phony dossier that turned out to be false, like false investigations that I've beaten. So a lot of my behavior was shaped by the fake news and by the other side. That was a lot of my behavior.
%
I caught the swamp. I caught 'em all.
%
I caught all of this corruption that was going on, and nobody else could have done it.
%
New York is a corrupt state. It's a corrupt state, it's a shame.
%
I gave $19 million away. And what happened is, instead of saying, 'Thank you, great,' they hit me with a lawsuit and it was started by a man [former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman] who had to get out because he beat up women.
%
I'm very transparent. Nobody is more transparent than I am.
%
And I'll tell you, the whistleblower, I call him the fake whistleblower. He gave a fake report of my phone call.
%
We are winning so big. My polls are the highest they've ever been, I'm leading in all of the states, every swing state.
%
Nancy Pelosi should go back to her district, which is horrible. It's filthy. It's drug-infested. The stuff's being flown out to the ocean -- it's being wiped out to the ocean through their drainage systems.
%
We're doing very well with African Americans.
%
I know Michael [Bloomberg]. He became just a nothing. He was really a nothing. He's not going to do well, but I think he's going to hurt Biden, actually. But he doesn't have the magic to do well.
%
Little Michael [Bloomberg] will fail. He'll spend a lot of money. He's got some really big issues. He's got some personal problems and he's got a lot of other problems.
%
There is nobody I'd rather run against than Little Michael [Bloomberg].
%
Just so you know, we have the highest poll numbers. We have the most energy.
%
I have to do what the lawyers say, to a certain extent; not always, but, you know, to a certain extent.
%
There shouldn't be impeachment hearings.
%
I am sure you will find it tantalizing!
%
They're trying to stop me, because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen.
%
NEVER TRUMPERS!
%
The Democrats have stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans. They have leaked out everything.
%
Sean [Hannity] the amazing warrior!
%
A total Impeachment Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats!
%
Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from “angels.” Some are very tough, hardened criminals.
%
Both Bidens should be forced to testify in this No Due Process Scam!
%
So true, and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves, and must hate our Country!
%
Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!
%
Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!
%
To think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!
%
Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts.
%
ABC is as bad as the rest of them. Journalistic standards are nonexistent today. The press is so dishonest that we no longer have Freedom of the Press!
%
But the Witch Hunt continues. After 3 years of relentless attacks against the Republican Party & me, the Do Nothing Dems are losers for America!
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
Bringing the word “Nationalism” back into the mainstream - great job by Rich Lowry! Very important book.
%
The LameStream Media, which is The Enemy of the People, is working overtime with made up stories in order to drive dissension and distrust!
%
Anybody wants to come in -- dictators, it's OK. Come on in. Whatever's good for the United States; we want to help our people.
%
They shouldn't be having public hearings.
%
I don't care if they're public; they should be public. What I said -- it was misreported, as usual. What I said is very simple: There shouldn't be anything. There shouldn't be impeachment hearings, is what I said. So maybe they misconstrued it.
%
But here's a guy [Schiff] that made up a conversation, totally, I mean, not even like -- he didn't use one word that I said. He just totally made it up, and it sounded terrible.
%

%
...just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don't exist.
%
With that being said, it's fake news. They wrote a fake story. We've told them that before they wrote the story. But today, when you tell the press something, it's meaningless because they write whatever -- it's all fiction. And I'll tell you, they don't have sources. You know what they do? They make it up. Not everybody -- not John, not everybody. But they make it up.
%
If our opponent had gotten in, this economy, instead of being up 60, 70%, would have been down 60 or 70%, and that's guaranteed.
%
The tape shows that Joe Biden is a crook. He's 100 percent crooked. And the fake news, which is you and you -- you don't want to do anything about it.
%
These people are bad people and it's so bad what they do to our country. They rip the guts out of a country and it's a shame, and they shouldn't be allowed to do it.
%
We are winning so big.
%
Just so you know, we have the highest poll numbers.
%
We have the highest car insurance in the entire nation by far. Some people call it auto insurance, call it whatever the heck you want.
%
We ended the war on American energy.
%
We ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.
%
The Democrats -- think of it. They want open borders, which means crime.
%
I have one problem. And it has been very hard on my family. Whoever heard — impeachment to me is a dirty word. It’s been very unfair, very hard on my family. Me, it’s my whole life, it’s crazy. What a life I lead. You think this is fun, don’t you? But it’s been very hard on my family. Very, very hard.
%
Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.
%
[To Zelensky]I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you.
%
#NewHoaxSameSwamp
%
A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?
%
So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr & Nellie, Steele & all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn’t they lie?...
%
We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost), and also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!
%
They call it “serving at the pleasure of the President.” The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O.
%
Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.

She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long.
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the......
......filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE. She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long. 
%
Democrats must apologize to USA!
%
THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS NOW DEAD!
%
the eyes of history are looking at the people of Louisiana. If you want to defend your values, your jobs, and your freedom, then you need to REPLACE... blah blah blah
%
Democrats must apologize to USA
%
A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?
%
You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight sometimes they get really treated very unfairly.
%
I know words. I have the best words.
%
I don't know him. I don't know, as he says, 'Lieutenant Colonel.' I understand somebody had him the misfortune of calling him 'Mr.' and he corrected them. I never saw the man. I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. No, I don't know Vindman at all.
%
If this were a prize fight, they'd stop it!
%
I have one of the greatest memories of all time.
%
I don’t remember much about that meeting.
%
I don't remember that, no. But I would have said Cody was a bad guy if I did.
%
As good as my memory is, I don't remember that.
%
My hearing is, and has been, great.
%
Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. 
%
FAKE & CORRUPT NEWS!
%
Corrupt politician Adam Schiff’s lies are growing by the day.
%
I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!
%
Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!
%
I am much richer than people even thought - And that is a good thing.
%
They [Apple] have it all - Money, Technology, Vision & Cook!
%
Fox should stay with the people that got them there, not losers!
%
Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER!
%
This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!
%
Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!
%
I WANT NOTHING!
%
Democrats' smear campaign is falling apart.
%
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the least productive Speaker of the House in history. 
%
The three year Hoax continues!
%
... in the end we will win and save our Country from certain destruction!
%
Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they & Fake News Media are her BOSS)
%
This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media & their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi & Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!
%
Where is the Fake Whistleblower?
%
The Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats are turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. 
%
...see the just released ststement from Ukraine.
%
Paul, just concede the game, say I was right, and lets start a brand new game!
%
Schiff is a Corrupt Politician!
%
@SteveScalise blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show.
%
Paul Krugman has called me wrong from day one. People at the Failing New York Times are very angry at him for having “missed” by soooo much. Paul, match over!
%
The Do Nothing Dems are now doing even less - and soooo much work to be done!
%
Mr. Chairman [Kim Jong Un], Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a “rabid dog.” He is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!

They were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top and everybody knows it and now we're going to find out.
%
They must think we're nuts in this country.
%
Now, Adam Schiff is a sick puppy.
%
What you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal.
%
...the word is, it's historic, that's what the word is. That's what I hear. And if it's historic, you're going to see something.
%
I don't like to use the word 'deep state.' I just say they're really bad, sick people.
%
OK, the information that we have now is beyond belief already. But what they have coming out, I hear, is historic.
%
Call it anti-Trump people.
%
Joe Biden is corrupt.
%
Remember it was trending number one.
%
Rudy Giuliani was one of the great crime fighters of all time. He's also a friend of mine. He's a great person. He's like an iconic figure in this country for two reasons. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York and he was the greatest crime fighter probably in the last 50 years.
%
Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person. You know, I've -- I said, why are you being so kind? Well, sir, she's a woman, we have to be nice.
%
This was not an angel, this woman, OK? And there are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like and we will talk about that at some time.
%
I know a lot about stardom. I know a lot about it. I've made plenty of them.
%
I mean Adam Schiff is -- is a nut job.
%
Why did Shifty Schiff, a crooked politician, a corrupt politician. Why did he make up my statement?
%
I have to deal with crazy Nancy. She is crazy as a bedbug. She is nuts.
%
We have loopholes, they are called loopholes for a reason because they are loopholes.
%
I don't know if Joe can make it mentally. He is off, there is no question about it. So, I don't know if he's going to make it mentally. If he can get through it without cracking up, which is a real question, many people have asked it.

Pete, I call him Alfred E. Neuman. It reminds me of Mad magazine Alfred E. Neuman.

Kellyanne is great. She is married to a total whack job. She must have done number on him. I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy.
%
Well a lot of things are the matter with me.
%
We had the best year we ever had by far.
%
I don't recall. No, not at all. Not even a little bit. 
%
But to me, it's clean air and crystal-clean, clear water. And we have now the cleanest air we've ever had in our country, meaning over the last 40 years.
%
I had 35 people in my office -- farmers, and builders, and ranchers, and others. Strong people, very strong -- men and women -- and almost all of them were crying. They said, 'You've given our life back.'
%
My daughter Ivanka, that's all she wants to talk about. I say, 'Ivanka, can we please talk about something else?' 'No, Dad. I met today with Walmart.'
%
They'd rule against us because they said, 'Hey, don't worry about the United States. They're the stupid people. Don't worry. Rule against them.'...Now, we're winning cases, because they really think that I'll do something very powerful, which we have the right to do. And they're right when they think that way.
%
And we have the greatest military force on Earth. It was depleted when I took over...We had a military that was so depleted, so bad...I could tell you stories about ammunition. They didn't have ammunition.

This is the first time, Secretary Azar, I think in 51 years, that prices have actually gone down...for prescription drugs. So, that's quite an achievement.

I stand with Hong Kong, I stand with freedom, I stand with all of the things that I want to do, but we are also in the process of making the largest trade deals in history.

First it was the Russia hoax, total hoax. It was a failed overthrow attempt and the biggest fraud in the history of our country and then you look, the Mueller deal, you remember that mess? They had nothing.
%
Now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged impeachment -- think of this: Impeachment. Impeachment. A witch hunt. ... They're pushing that impeachment witch hunt and a lot of bad things are happening to them.
%
I would bring back waterboarding, and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.

Just this week I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state. You know what I'm talking about. And so many people said, 'Sir, I don't think you should do that.'

I never got the turkey. A gorgeous piece of turkey.

We flew 8331 miles to be here tonight for one simple reason, to tell you in person that this Thanksgiving is a special Thanksgiving. We’re doing so well. Our country is the strongest economically it’s ever been. We’ve never done so well. We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. So it is nice to know that you are fighting for something that is doing well as opposed to something that was not doing well just a number of years ago.

I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn't even be allowed.
%
Thank you to President Zelensky. Case over. The Do Nothing Democrats should finally go back to work!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only. The Failing New York Times thinks that is O.K., because their hatred & bias is so great they can’t even see straight. It’s not O.K.!
%
If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over!
%
I thought Newsweek was out of business?
%
I don't think [President Xi Jinping] likes me so much anymore.
%
That's the reason [Macron] is a great politician, because that was one of the greatest non-answers I've ever heard. And that's okay.
%
I never met him. I don't know who Putin is.
%
NATO is obsolete. It's old. It's fat. It's sloppy.
%
[Justin Trudeau] is two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy. But the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% and I guess he's not very happy about it.
%
I hate it. I meet these people they call them 'the elite.' These people. I look at them, I say, 'That's elite?' We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we're smarter than they are, and they say they're elite? We're the elite. You're the elite. We're the elite.
%
We have the most powerful military we've ever had and we're by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don't have to use it, but if we do, we'll use it. If we have to, we'll do it
%
Heading to a meeting now with those countries that have met their 2% GOALS, followed by meetings with Denmark and Italy....
%
That was funny when I said the guy's two-faced.
%
The world is laughing at us. We gotta make 'em stop.
%
The world is laughing at us. They're laughing at the stupidity of our president.
%
The world is laughing at us. They think we're stupid.
%
We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be.
%
Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment.
%
Well, I think it was fantastic. I think they have to end it now. He said there was no quid pro quo. 'The President did absolutely nothing wrong.'
%
Support for Impeachment is dropping like a rock, down into the 20's in some Polls.
%
...you have a Chelsea Manning who stole classified information and did many, many things that were not good and gets pardoned -- or whatever happened...
%
But if you read the crooked New York Times, if you read the Washington Post -- which is just a horrible paper... I want them to get correct news, not fake news, but they're bad people.
%
Hey, I look over, I say, 'There's nobody in that car, what's going on?'
%
Do you see what's happening in the polls? Everybody said, 'That's really bullshit.' Everybody.
%
Why isn't Germany putting up money? Why isn't France putting up money? Why isn't all of the European nations, why aren't they putting up?
%
I'm sorry, but we don't need help, we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody. Thank all of the European countries. They each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.
%
Even look at what I've done for Ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff. And Obama would send pillows and sheets. He wouldn't send anything else.
%
When I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone, you can read it. He didn't like her. He brought up her name and he didn't like her at all.
%
This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful, she wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. ... She's in charge of the embassy. She wouldn't hang it. It took like a year and a half, or two years, for her to get the picture up.
%
I was actually the man of the year in Michigan about 10 years before the election, if you can believe it. That was unrelated to politics, right.
%
We go out, we never have an empty seat.
%
The Democrats would not give me anything, any money, didn't matter -- billions and billions for anything except the wall.
%
Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn't care about American Workers!
%
The floors of the forests are filthy, dirty, meaning, feet of leaves and fallen timber. 
%
I was with the president of Finland and he said: ‘We have, much different, we are a forest nation.’ He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don’t have any problem.
%
I'm very happy with China right now. They're paying us billions and billions.
%
I'm helping people that need help because China is paying us tremendous. And they're paying for it. Those tariffs are not paid by us.
%
You know, if you look back, everybody said China was going to capture the United States in terms of the economy, it would surpass the United States within the second year of the presidency -- you know when I was running, they kept saying that.
%
If Crooked Hillary had won, China would now be the largest economy in the world. They were going to surpass us, expected to, in the second year of the presidency.
%
We've had the best year we've ever had by far.
%
I flew to Texas, the great State of Texas, and I opened up an Apple computer plant.
%
We ended the last administration's war on American energy.

I shouldn't do it, I shouldn't do it because we lose a small audience when that happens.

He really likes sending rockets up, doesn't he? That's why I call him Rocket Man.
%
If you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast.
%
We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.
%
Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she “prays for the President.” I don’t believe her, not even close.
%
Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?
%
The Democrats have gone crazy. And you know what? They have to be careful. Because when the shoe is on the other foot... And some day, hopefully in the very long distant future, you'll have a Democrat president, you'll have a Republican house, and they'll do the same thing because someone picked an orange out of the refrigerator and you don't like it, so let's go and impeach him.
%
We had a case where we had an African American guy who was a fan of mine. Great fan. Great guy! In fact, I want to find out what's going on with him. You know what I ... Oh, look at my African American over here. Look at him!
%
As far as witholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid.
%
You turn on the faucet and you don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out.
%
People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.
%
You go into a new building or a new house or a new home and they have standards only you don't get water. You can't wash your hands practically, there's so little water comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands.
%
There may be some areas where we'll go the other route -- desert areas -- but for the most part you have many states where they have so much water -- it comes down, it's called rain. They don't know what to do with it.
%
Being a vain person, that's really important to me. It gives you an orange look, I don't want an orange look.
%
Right now the cars are made out of papier-mache, and ours are actually, we allow steel content.
%
We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on -- and in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.
%
You love my hair? She knows what to say. She knows how to make me happy.
%
A lot of you are in the real estate business 'cos I know you very well. You're brutal killers. Not nice people at all. But you have to vote for him, you have no choice. You're not gonna vote for Pokahontas, I can tell you that.
%
Even if some of you don't like me. Some of you I don't like at all, actually. And you're gonna be my biggest supporters because you'll be out of business in about 15 minutes if they get in. So I don't have to spend a lot of time on that. 
%
So we'll count from 5 down to that very special number...
%
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding... extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!
%
Did you know anything about this? Did you have any role? Mohammed, I need to know. Was there a bone saw? Because if there was a bone saw, that changes everything. I mean, I've been in some pretty tough negotiations. I've never had to take a bone saw with me.
%
This is a huge problem. Where's the body? We've got to resolve this. We've got to get his body back to his family.
%
[to MBS re: Khashoggi killing] You know, we're sticking by you. This is an important relationship.
%
Everyone said this is impeachment-lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country, by far. It's not even like an impeachment.
%
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100.
%
I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany.
%
[Greta Thunberg] seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!
%
So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!
%
I also have constantly asked, “Why aren’t Germany, France and other European countries helping Ukraine more? They are the biggest beneficiaries. Why is it always the good ol’ United States?” The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, never mention this at their phony hearing!
%
ANTIFA will not be going after Bryce or @ColbyCovMMA anytime soon. They much prefer people who can’t fight back!

Dirty cops!

I will be there [Maralago] in two weeks, The Southern White House!
%
After years of rebuilding OTHER NATIONS, we are finally rebuilding OUR NATION. In everything we do, we are putting AMERICA FIRST!
%
I raised $530 Billion more from NATO countries!
%
They spied on my campaign!
%
It’s great to have a wonderful subject, President Trump. Fake News like CNN & MSNBC are dying. If they treated me fairly, they would do well. Have Zero credibility!
%
The News Media in our Country is FAKE and in many cases, totally CORRUPT!
%
Day after day, we are exposing the depravity, dishonesty and sickness of the corrupt Washington establishment — and with your help, we are going to complete the mission and DRAIN THE SWAMP!
%
I love Hershey chocolate!
%
To Impeach a President who has proven through results, including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country’s history, to have one of the most successful presidencies ever, and most importantly, who has done NOTHING wrong, is sheer Political Madness!
%
With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI.
%
Don't let the Impeachment Sham distract from the fact that the Obama FBI was just faulted for numerous "omissions" and "inaccuracies" in the IG Report.
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are a disgrace!
%
The best Economy ever!
%
AMERICA FIRST!
%
CNN is a ratings disaster. Lost all credibility!
%
What he did is illegal. Schiff is a corrupt politician and a criminal!
%
The Wall is going up fast!
%
I got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more, and the U.S. less, and came home to a Fake News Media that mocked me. Didn’t think that was possible!
%
The Dems wouldn’t let @FoxNews get near their bad ratings debates, yet Fox panders. Pathetic!
%
Our Economy is the envy of the World!
%
While the world is not doing well economically, our Country is doing better, perhaps, than it has ever done before.
%
Why is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money, and if they don’t, they create it. STOP!
%
Without the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems!
%
Do not believe any article or story you read or see that uses “anonymous sources” having to do with trade or any other subject. Only accept information if it has an actual living name on it. The Fake News Media makes up many “sources say” stories. Do not believe them!
%
Where’s the Fake Whistleblower? Where’s Whistleblower number 2? Where’s the phony informer who got it all wrong?

Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit.

The Do Nothing, Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. 
%
I was elected to “Clean the Swamp.”
%
Proudly for our Country, no President has ever achieved so much in so little time.
%
Such a thing has never been done before!

The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO.

No increase for U.S., only deep respect!

%
I think that the whole impeachment thing... hoax... I guess you could call it a hoax, 'cos it is a hoax... Nancy Pelosi knows it... by the way, they duped her yesterday. 
%
[Impeachment] seems to be good for me politically.
%
I could show you numbers that people have never seen numbers like that before, so the impeachment is a hoax. It's a sham. It started a looong time ago. Probably before I came down the escalator with the future First Lady. 
%
Crooked Hillary... is as crooked as a three dollar bill.
%
I’ll do whatever I want.
%
We've ended the war on clean Pencilvanal...

Like we used to say in the military, make a path. Mark, I don't know how... come on. Come on up, Mark. He's so big. Right Mark? Come on over.

When during the campaign I would say, 'Mexico's going to pay for it,' obviously I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check.
%
I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily.
%
The world is not doing well and we're going great.

By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German shepherd.

How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?

Yeah, Obama had a dog. You're right. Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration.
%
I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession, and we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.

Now I do politics.

In fact, [Barack Obama] told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.
%
I found some very old laws from when our country was rich. Really rich. The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off. You could hardly see, they were so dusty.

%
Can you imagine? Sleepy Joe? Crazy Bernie.

I think Pocahontas, she's finished, she's out. She's gone. No, when it was found that I had more Indian blood in me than she did.
%
But can you imagine any of these people up here doing what I'm doing? They'd be 200 people show up if they were president. If they were president, nobody would show up.

%
I think I can say I really got to know [Queen Elizabeth] because I sat with her many times. And we had automatic chemistry. You understand that feeling.
%
I think [Pelosi is] a disgrace. I actually don't think she's a talented person. I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.
%
We have Pelosi, we have Crying Chuck Schumer, who's a disaster, by the way. He's a total political, you know, jerk.
%
There are those that say they have never seen the Queen have a better time, a more animated time.
%
Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money.
%
We are not fools anymore. We are not the foolish country that does so badly.

We are -- if you look at China, China, as great as they are and they are great, they are near the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in undershirts and they were not $2 billion a piece.
%
I have to tell you, [Biden is] a different guy. He looks different than he used to. He acts different than he used to. He's even slower than he used to be.
%
The crime was by the Democrats, folks. They've committed, in my opinion, many crimes.

I think [Biden is] the weakest, mentally. And I like running against people that are weak, mentally.

The farmers are my best friend.

It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!
%
You view democracy as your enemy!
%
Your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.
%
There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don't know that you will ever give me a chance to do so.
%
You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are the ones Obstructing Justice.
%
Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left.
%
Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger -- this is what is driving impeachment.
%
Do not take our country down with your party.
%
Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life.
%
More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.
%
History will judge you harshly as you proceed with ths impeachment charade.
%
The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing.
%
[The American people] will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power.
%
By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy
%
Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!
%
This should never happen to another President again. Say a PRAYER!
%
After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans.
%
"Crazy Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame."
%
Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president.
%
Debbie Dingell, that's a real beauty.
%
Now I watch [Debbie Dingell] ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax. Really pathetic!
%
I'm very impressed by [Nancy Pelosi]. I think she's a very impressive person. I like her a lot.
%
It just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which personally I think would've been a wonderful thing.
%
Look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant and they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And yet Bush got us into this horrible war with lies. By lying.
%
IN REALITY THEY'RE NOT AFTER ME THEY'RE AFTER YOU
%
The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!
%
I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history.
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!
%
[Nancy Pelosi] Will go down in history as worst Speaker. Already thrown out once!
%
They want to Impeach me (I’m not worried!), and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways.
%
These people are Crazy!
%
Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst!
%
If they vote yes [on impeachment], it will be much easier for Republicans to win in 2020!
%
Impeachment Poll numbers are starting to drop like a rock now that people are understanding better what this whole Democrat Scam is all about!
%
The Stock Market hit another Record High yesterday, number 133 in less than three years as your all time favorite President
%
I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates.
%
Think of where I’d be without the never ending, 24 hour a day, phony Witch Hunt, that started 3 years ago!
%
Congressional Do Nothing Democrats are being absolutely decimated in their districts on the subject of the Impeachment Hoax. People that voted for them are literally screaming in their faces.
%
Crazy Nancy is finding defending Shifty Schiff harder than she thought!
%
Nancy’s teeth were falling out of her mouth, and she didn’t have time to think!
%
God blesh the United Shtatesh
%
Where are the apologies to me and others, Jim?
%
Crooked Hillary caught again. She is a total train wreck!
%
The Fake News Media should apologize to all!
%
Both Commiecast MSNBC & Fake News CNN are watching their Ratings TANK.
%
Hard to believe that @FoxNews will be interviewing sleazebag & totally discredited former FBI Director James Comey, & also corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff.
%
Too bad Cryin’ Chuck!
%
25 Million Evangelical Christians are not registered to vote. We are working hard to get them registered!
%
Look at their field - no wonder they're petrified!
%
It’s not fair that I’m being Impeached when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong!
%
The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have become the Party of Hate. They are so bad for our Country!
%
Fake News. They should find a better leaker!
%
CNN and MSNBC have totally tanked, their ratings are terrible. They have zero credibility!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats have become the Party of lies and deception! The Republicans are the Party of the American Dream!
%
It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached. The country is doing better than ever before. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong.
%
You know, I know windmills very much. I've studied it better than anybody I know.
%
It's very expensive. They're made in China and Germany mostly -- very few made here, almost none. But they're manufactured tremendous -- if you're into this -- tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe.
%
You talk about the carbon footprint -- fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it's in China, Germany, it's going into the air. It's our air, their air, everything -- right?
%
So they make these things [windmills] and then they put them up. And if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters, your house is worth 50% of the price.
%
They're noisy. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go. Take a look. A bird graveyard. Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life.
%
You know, in California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true.
%
After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way. This is -- they make you turn it off after you -- and yet, if you killed one they put you in jail. That's OK. But why is it OK for these windmills to destroy the bird population? And that's what they're doing.
%
She was raped and killed, strangled to death. [She wasn't killed. Trump fantasy reporting again.]
%
I've won virtually every race that I've participated in.
%
I don't want to be policing a border that's been fought over for 2,000 years. [The border is less than 100 years old]
%
We're not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that's been fought over for 2,000 years. [The border is less than 100 years old]
%
This was an overthrow of government. This was an attempted overthrow. And a lot of people who were in on it, and they got caught. They got caught red-handed. [Untrue, of course...]
%
This poor guy [Peter Strzok] -- did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa [Page]? That's what I heard. I don't know if it's true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that's what I heard, I don't know.
%
Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion... the Bible. [Beto spoke about removing the tax-exempt status of any entity "that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us," which clearly doesn't match Trump's fantasy reporting.]
%
You're not going to vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that. You're not going to vote for the wealth tax. "Yeah, let's take 100% of your wealth away." [Because an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion is all the wealth?]
%
The ocean's going to rise. One eighth of an inch within the next 250 years. We're going to be wiped out!
%
The whistleblower wrote a totally false statement. So it's a fraud.
%
They didn't even know, probably, that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful. [The cover page stated clearly it wasn't a complete transcription. There were lots of ommissions, which were clearly marked.]
%
Where's the whistleblower? He's disappeared, he's gone...the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly...
%
The first whistleblower, who was all set to testify, he -- all of a sudden, he becomes this saint-like figure that they don't need him anymore.
%
So now there's no informer. There's no second whistleblower. Everybody has gone.
%
The other thing nobody remembers and nobody likes to talk about -- and I talk about it all the time -- is why isn't Germany, why isn't France, why aren't other European countries paying? Because we're paying. The suckers...
%
We ended the last administration's war on American energy. The United States is now -- and I said it, and I'll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And there's nobody even close. [That's actually been the case for energy since 2012 and natural gas since 2009.]
%
We never used to win before me.
%
Right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border telling people, 'You can't come in.'
%
I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit...And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said 'yes,' and everybody smiled and they laughed. [He was in Turnberry AFTER the vote...]
%
Those windmills, wah wah wah! 'Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results, darling, there's no wind, the damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it's global warming.'
%
Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean. I want -- and that's what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been, OK, with all that we're doing.
%
David is the largest landlord in the country by a factor of about 50. By a -- when we think we big landlords, he controls half of the United States, actually.
%
Even if people said there was no crime in fact there's no impeachment. Their own lawyers said there's no impeachment. [It was 2 university professors debating. Not lawyers, and not impacting reality.]
%
Maybe it's a nice present. Maybe it's a present where he sends me a beautiful vase instead of a missile test.
%
Everybody's got surprises for me. I handle it as it comes along.
%
I may get a vase. I may get a nice present from him. You don't know. You never know.

Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!
%
Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States?
%
Wow. It’s all a giant SCAM!
%
The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve  something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment. She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal!
%
The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have gone CRAZY. They want to make it as hard as possible for me to properly run our Country!
%
What a great time for the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats to Impeach your favorite President, especially since he has not done anything wrong!
%
What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None!
%
No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!
%
Nancy Pelosi, who has already lost the House & Speakership once, & is about to lose it again
%
[Pelosi] lost Congress once, she will do it again!
%
The Democrats and Crooked Hillary paid for & provided a Fake Dossier, with phony information gotten from foreign sources, pushed it to the corrupt media & Dirty Cops, & have now been caught. They spied on my campaign, then tried to cover it up - Just Like Watergate, but bigger!
%
The Dems just wish it would all end. Their case is dead, their poll numbers are horrendous!
%
Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever.
%
New planes, ships, missiles, rockets and equipment of every kind, and all made right here in the USA.
%
The great Democrat disgrace. But we are winning!
%
Read the Transcripts. A Democrat Hoax!
%
Nancy Pelosi is looking for a Quid Pro Quo with the Senate. Why aren’t we Impeaching her?
%
Look forward to another great defense bill next year, Mac!
%
The relationship between the United States and Brazil has never been Stronger!
%
The Democrat Party’s Witch Hunt and CRAZY EXTREME policies are chasing common sense people out of the Dem Party.
%
The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!
%
No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it’s not even close. You’ll not get anything from those Dems on stage.
%
I won’t be reading ET [Evangelical Times] again!
%
SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!

I guess Justin T. doesn't much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!

Nancy Pelosi's District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast - she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!
%
Crazy Nancy Pelosi should spend more time in her her decaying city and less time on the Impeachment Hoax!
%
If [California's] Governors can’t handle the situation, which they should be able to do very easily, they must call and “politely” ask for help. Would be so easy with competence!
%
[Comey] A Dirty Cop at the highest level. Scum!
%
So sad to see that New York City and State are falling apart. All they want to do is investigate to make me hate them even more than I should. Governor Cuomo has lost control, and lost his mind. Very bad for the homeless and all!
%
California and New York must do something about their TREMENDOUS Homeless problems. They are setting records!
%
Wow Crazy Nancy, what’s going on? This is big stuff!
%
Our great First Lady. She really cares!
%
Hillary should give it another try, but this time don’t forget Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina & others!
%
Come on Crazy Nancy, do it!
%
Thank YOU Indian Country for being such an IMPORTANT part of the American story!
%
Crazy Nancy should focus on that in her very down district, and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem!
%
Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib Province. Don’t do it!
%
Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years, it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats & their bogus Impeachment Scam. Bad for USA!

[Nancy Pelosi is] all lies. Most overrated person I know!
%
Very good meeting on the Middle East, the Military, and Trade. Heading back to The Southern White House (Mar-a-Lago!).
%
Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!

Crazy Nancy Pelosi should spend more time in her decaying city and less time on the Impeachment Hoax!
%
The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!).
%
Now that Obama's poll numbers are in a tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.
%
[re: war with Iran] You're not going to need an exit strategy. I don't need exit strategies.
%
In order to get elected, @BarackObama will start a war with Iran.
%
Our president [Barack Obama] is about to start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. He's weak, and he's ineffective. So the only way he figures he's going to get re-elected, and as sure as you're sitting there, is to start a war with Iran.
%
Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.
%
Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!
%
I say that he starts a war in Iran before the election, which will make it very hard for the Republican to win. He'll start a war, you know, lives will be wasted for no reason.
%
In my opinion, Obama will start a war. For about three weeks it'd be very popular about, by the way, six months later he'll be very unpopular, but by that time it's too late.
%
I do believe [Barack Obama] will do it [start a war with Iran] -- whether he does it under the guise of Israel or not -- but I do believe he would do it. I've been making that prediction. Let's see what happens. Many of my predictions, as you know better than anybody have come true.
%
[Democrats] want to close up your steel mills. They don't want your steel mills.
%
He's on tape. He's -- if that were me, it's the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated.
%
Every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk.
%
We set records at every one, because we use the floor...But we use the floor, right, the basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mentioned the crowds. They never mention the crowds, it's sort of amazing.
%
In the past, you press it, boom, and the dishwasher cycle would run and be finished in five minutes. Now, you press it 12 times, women tell me. By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water and electric. Don't forget.
%
When a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump. So let's say over here in Battle Creek, where's your nearest dump? OK, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time... you lose, drive a couple of hundred miles.
%
We fined San Francisco -- and Los Angeles and San Francisco. But we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing.
%
You know in California, you go to jail for five years if you kill a bald eagle. You go under a windmill, you see ’em all over the place. Not a good situation. But that’s what they are counting on — wind.
%
Go under a windmill sometime, you’ll see the saddest — you’ve got every type of bird.
%
When the wind doesn’t blow, you don’t watch television that night. Your wife says, ‘What the hell did you get me into with this Green New Deal, Charlie?’
%
The Chinese are illegally dumping bird-killing wind turbines on our shores. Only one of many grievances--we should act.
%
I never understood wind.
%
Windmills cause cancer.
%
A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true. And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way.
%
They talked about building a train to Hawaii, can you believe it? No, no, she wants it, even though you can't -- you'll never get to Hawaii again. Say goodbye to Hawaii. No, it's crazy, isn't it, though?
%
What they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product. That means you basically won't have any factories in the United States.
%
We are shattering every record!
%
Did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas.
%
Let me begin by wishing you a beautiful -- look, do you remember this? Do you remember they were trying to take 'Christmas' out of Christmas? Do you remember? They didn't want to let you say 'Merry Christmas.' You would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything -- red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. Everything was there, but they wouldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' They're all saying 'Merry Christmas' again. You remember? I went through that, during the campaign: 'They going to say Merry Christmas again.' And they are.
%
You know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way -- other than the very, very beginning, before I -- I think, I -- long before I announced -- a little bit.
%
And again, Roger Stone was not a part of it... the campaign. He was somebody I've known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. Very, very, very early on, long before I... I think long before I even announced, he was involved in a minor way.
%
Three years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary.
%
They saved 16,000 lives. Nobody understands what that means. 16,000. Even me, I heard that number, and I said, 'Can that be possible? Sixteen thousand.' They served 16,000 lives -- and saved.
%
As you know, we're now getting along very well with China and trade.
%
The great USMCA Trade Deal [Mexico & Canada] has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk for 8 months, she doesn't even know what it says.
%
The Democrat Party is trying to shred our Constitution, tear down our history, erase the nation's borders. They don't want to have any borders.
%
The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true. They write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write.
%
...it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax.
%
These Media Posts [a.k.a. tweets] will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!
%
IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!
%
U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration.
%
So now we have South Korea, we just finished the big one, $40 billion with Japan on January 15, we are signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, $40 billion to $50 billion to our farmers.

The Space Force... everybody is excited about that.

They go home to mommy. They're going home to mommy. They are going home to mommy. It's a beautiful sight. Thank you, security. Do we love law enforcement, by the way?
%
We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck.
%
Nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it is loose.
%
That is the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful. Then they started hitting us all the time, and it became unsuccessful. I love it. I love it, actually.
%
I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, what? Did I have something do with it? Yes.
%
I saved a big war. I saved a couple of them.
%
You know, outside, I don't know what this place holds, like 10,000 or 11,000 people, right? Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in.
%
Now I have completed more promises than I have made.
%
He calls me Mr. President. I've known this guy forever. He used to call me, 'Hey, Don, let's go out to dinner.' You know, before, he'll go, 'Hey, let's go out to dinner.' Now he goes, 'Mr. President, sir, how are you?'
%
So we have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again.
%
So Crooked Hillary... wait.. Crooked Hillary... you should lock her up, I will tell you.
%
We are selling that hat like nobody has ever sold a hat before, I will say. So it's great. Good.
%
They say, they did a poll on this. I think I remember the numbers. All you know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe. We won.
%
I don't know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln -- I always say, I can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any president, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when he is wearing his hat.
%
I should watch -- you know, I'm supposed to watch, it's like my job, try and watch. Watch the competition. But it's like watching death.
%
I said, we have to have "Where is Hunter" as a witness and they said, what do you mean, "Where is Hunter?" I said, that's his first name. I have now made his first name, "Where is".. "Where is Hunter?"
%
So where is Hunter? Where the hell are you, Hunter?
%
And they just called today, five of the most respected people and they said things that were incredible. They said there's never been anything like this in the church that they can remember.
%
While every Democrat running for president wants to shut down our coal mines, we are putting our miners back to work. Dig we must. Dig we must.

You know, there is a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot.
%
The steel industry was dead, and now it is vibrant.

The Democrats are taking their cues from the socialist Bernie Sanders and that girl.
%
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
%
I looked at some of that hydraulics and I'm -- I love the whole thing, the world of tractors and all of that stuff. I know a lot about it.
%
A lot of crooked people, disgusting, crooked people.
%
I would have no problem, other than we have to protect ... people can't go up and say whatever my thoughts are. ... We don't want that to be out, so we have to protect presidential privilege.

I don't believe [Russia] interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point.

[Saudi Arabia has] been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.

The powerful Trump Wall is replacing porous, useless and ineffective barriers in the high traffic areas requested by Border Patrol.

Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
%
Dems are “unhinged.”
%
[Nancy Pelosi] will go down as perhaps the least successful Speaker in U.S. History!
%
I love constantly proving them wrong. It’s easy!
%
Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!
%
Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution.

All of a sudden [Pete Buttigieg] become extremely religious. This happened about two weeks ago.

We have a judge in Texas, I believe he's 38 years old. He went to Harvard, he was the top student. I believe he went to Oxford or something like that. He's 38 years old.

Others have tried for decades, and failed!
%
Even a thing like Merry Christmas. Remember I used to go around -- in the summer, I'd say, we're going to say Christmas again. We're going to say Christmas again. And now they're all saying Merry Christmas again, right? They're all saying it. You'd go to these big department stores three years ago four years ago and they'd have the snow and they'd have the red and the white, they'd have everything, but they wouldn't say Christmas. I said where's Merry Christmas and they said we can't say it They're all saying it again. They're saying it proudly.
%
Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!

Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong?

The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy.

Anything I do, whether it’s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical Left, Do Nothing Democrats!

Bernie Sander’s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth “Pocahontus” Warren.

Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?

Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party.

Ask why hearing was most unfair & biased in history?
%
We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements.
%
But sinks, toilets and showers. You don't get any water. They put restrictors on and now they made them permanent.
%
Try going and buying a new faucet. You turn it on, no water comes out. Right? We won't talk about toilets, but you know that's true. Ten, fifteen -- but we don't talk about that.
%
You go into a shower, and I have this beautiful head of hair. I need a lot of water. You go into the shower, right? You turn on the water. Drip, drip, drip.
%
So we're getting rid of the restrictors, you're going to have full shower flow. You'll see. Did you ever go to the faucet, you turn on the faucet to wash your hands, and it turns on so easy. It's like this, you know, because there's zero pressure behind it, no water. You go like that the thing flips on and whoa. And then dunk, dunk. These people are crazy.
%
I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, OK? I want to pay less money to look better.
%
Uh, dishwashers, and uh, you know. I won't tell you one of the things because every time I tell you they do a big number on it. You know the one I'm talking about, right? Sinks, right? Showers? And what goes with a sink and a shower? ... Ten times, right? Ten times. Babap!"
%
Nnow you press [the dishwasher] 12 times. Women tell me.
%
By the way... some of the congressmen may have a vote, and I don't... it's on the impeachment hoax. So if you want, you can go on and vote. I'd rather have, frankly, it's not gonna matter because it's going very well... They have a hoax going on over there. Let's take care of it.
%
Really tough. I love that.
%
Why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy!
%
Steyer is running low on cash. Nobody knows him. Made his money on coal. So funny!
%
We are a big tent, & a big party, w/ BIG IDEAS for the future!
%
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker, the American Family, and the American Dream!
%
This Impeachment Hoax is an outrage!
%
The right to pray in public schools... you have the right to pray. That's a very important and powerful right. There is nothing more important than that, I would say.
%
....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
%
They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from Crazy Bernie, just like last time. Some things never change!
%
That’s what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away.
%
Make Iran Great Again!
%
The so-called “Supreme Leader” of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe.
%
Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair, but that’s the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it’s a lot of fun to watch!
%
I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!
%
Why are they doing this to me?
%
I never had a lawyer who took notes.
%
My office resembled an emergency room, but instead of patients, there were lawyers crowding around.
%
No one satisfied me.
%
Democrats are trying to make him sound like [Soleimani] was this wonderful human being.
%
I mean, I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country [Ethiopia], and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country.
%
What -- you know what I -- what bothers me? When I see a Nancy Pelosi trying to defend this monster from Iran, who has killed so many people, who has so badly -- I mean, so many people are walking around now without legs and without arms. Because he was the big roadside bomb guy.
%
We've gotten rid of ISIS.
%
I know it's true, because I've said it 50 times and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me.
%
We ended the war on clean, beautiful coal.
%
Clean coal. What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal.
%
What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country!
%
I want to know who are the 17%. Who are they? Who the hell are the 17%? Anybody in here from the 17% Don't raise your hand. It may be dangerous.
%
He had the big beautiful cowboy hat on. I love that hat. I wish we could wear them in Washington and in New York, because I would be the biggest buyer for that hat.
%
Is there anybody here who does not love their children and does not want to leave their beautiful farm to their children? Do you mean there is not one person who dislikes their children because they're brats? Spoiled rotten brats?
%
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
%
The fact is, the Fake News Media hates talking about the Economy, and how incredible it is!
%
We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!!
%
Nancy can’t fix it. The Do Nothing Dems have done great harm to our Country!
%
It was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017,  that I was sworn into office. So appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY.
%
I do not consider [traumatic brain injuries suffered by US troops] to be bad injuries, no.
%
I don't consider [traumatic brain injuries suffered by US troops] very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen.
%
I'd love to go [sit in on the impeachment trial]. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be beautiful?
%
I would love to speak because *we've* done nothing wrong.
%
I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton.
%
You don't like people testifying when they didn't leave on good terms and that was due to me. Not due to him.
%
I don't know him, other than he's sort of like a groupie. He shows up at fundraisers.
%
I don't want there to be a conflict. I'd love to have Rudy on my team, but he could be a witness at some point if this whole sham continues. I would love to have Rudy on the team.
%
Now, with me, there's no lying.
%
I have, in Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.
%
When it's fair, and it will be fair in the Senate, I would love to have Mike Pompeo, I'd love to have Mick (Mulvaney), I'd love to have Rick Perry and many other people testify.
%
You have to give [Elon Musk] credit. I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And -- he does good at rockets too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before.
%
And I was worried about [Elon Musk], because he's one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius. You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that -- came up with originally the light bulb and -- the wheel and all of these things. And he's one of our very smart people and we want to-- we want to cherish those people.
%
[Rudi Gulliani] knows corruption really better than anybody.
%
I mean, I'm not a baby!
%
Then I have an article 2, where I have the right to do anything I want as president. But I don't even talk about that.
%
That's the other thing. If you use your rights, if you use your power, if you use article 2, it's called obstruction.
%
Also some day you aught to read a thing called article 2. Read article 2, that gives the president powers that you wouldn't believe.
%
It's very hard to get through that whole thing [the American Constitution] without a stumble. It's like a different language, right? It's like a foreign language.
%
People don't realize this. We are an unbelievably divided country.
%
The buck stops with everybody.
%
My intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I'd disagree with them 100%
%
Some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers.
%
I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called Tivo.
%
USMCA, like the song YMCA, right?
%
In London you have stabbings all over. I read an article where everybody's being stabbed. They said your hospital is a sea of blood all over the floors.
%
We have our own Jackie O today. It's called Milania. Milania. We'll call it Milania T.
%
I don't have time to celebrate.
%
If you gotta cough, please leave the room.
%
Number one, she's not my type.
%
I think Canada is happy, but they're not happy like we're happy. But they're very happy.
%
We're gonna have a lot of fun tonight. I have nothing to do.
%
The Russian Hoax was a pure hoax!
%
I watch my words very, very closely.
%
Yea, a lot of things are the matter with me.
%
I think Ken Star is a lunatic. I really think that Ken Star is a disaster.
%
The Do Nothing Democrats just keep repeating and repeating, over and over again, the same old “stuff” on the Impeachment Hoax.
%
Cryin’ Chuck never had what it takes, and never will!
%
The Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election - But that was the idea behind the Radical Left, Do Nothing Dems Scam attack.
%
After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud & deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer & their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.
%
Crazy Bernie takes the lead in the Democrat Primaries, but it is looking more and more like the Dems will never allow him to win! Will Sleepy Joe be able to stumble across the finish line?
%
Democrats are going to destroy your Social Security. I have totally left it alone, as promised, and will save it!
%
The Democrats don’t want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden’s, the fake Whistleblower(& his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the so-called “informer”, & many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals.
%
No matter what you give to the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, it will never be enough!
%
The Democrats are trying hard to damage Republicans prior to the Election!
%
They are taking the nomination away from Bernie for a second time. Rigged!
%
Steyer is a major loser. Just doesn’t get it.
%
Big story. Hope Fake News covers it!
%
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
%
Americans are sick of the Swamp. They want results, not partisan theater.
%
What my people have to do is just be honest, just tell the truth.
%
[Some troops] had headaches, and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report, it's not very serious.
%
You have this one woman, Maxine Waters, I say she’s a very low IQ person. You don’t hear from her anymore. It’s the craziest thing. Since I’ve said that, I don’t hear from her anymore.
%
Ukraine has oil... Ukraine? How come they don’t have any money? Why aren’t companies going in, too risky?
%
Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!
%
Our case against lyin’, cheatin’, liddle’ Adam “Shifty” Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, their leader, dumb as a rock AOC, & the entire Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrat Party, starts today at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews, @OANN or Fake News @CNN or Fake News MSDNC!
%
Really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen, the no name Senator from Maryland. He has been on forever playing up the Impeachment Hoax.
%
Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television (with terrible ratings!).
%
That reporter couldn't have done too good a job on you yesterday, huh? I think you did a good job on her, actually.
%
No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!
%
GAME OVER!
%
We have the hottest ECONOMY on earth!
%
I'm not like the politicians who passed NAFTA.
%
I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy.
%
GAME OVER!
%
The Dems are scamming America!
%
BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE, the USMCA, was signed yesterday and the Fake News Media barely mentioned it. They never thought it could be done. They have zero credibility!
%
[Schiff's] District is in terrible shape. He is a corrupt pol who only dreams of the Impeachment Hoax. In my opinion he is mentally deranged!
%
We have the best experts anywhere in the world.
%
This Address will be unlike any other. Your President is in the middle of an all-out IMPEACHMENT WAR, and the Left is doing everything they can to try and take me down. They’re trying to take you down.
%
Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn’t do for @CoryBooker and others.
%
Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It’s all the Fake News Media, and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.
%
Me and this administration -- we've done more than any administration in the history of our country.
%
Look at Sleepy Joe, what’s going on with him? He’s having a hard time.
%
I call [Elizabeth Warren] ‘Fairy Tale’ because everything’s a fairy tale. This woman can’t tell the truth.
%
I think he's a communist. I think of communism when I think of Bernie ... didn't he get married in Moscow?
%
Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie.
%
Nobody’s made achievements like we’ve made, so many different things.
%
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country.
%
With our great Economy and other major successes, would be 20 points higher without the phony Witch Hunts and Hoaxes???
%
The Democrat Party in Iowa really messed up, but the Republican Party did not.
%
When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?
%
It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault. As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!
%
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country.
%
Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!
%
The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump”.
%
Where’s the Whistleblower? Where’s the second Whistleblower? Where’s the Informer? Why did Corrupt politician Schiff MAKE UP my conversation with the Ukrainian President??? Why didn’t the House do its job? And sooo much more!
%
Nothing will ever satisfy the Do Nothing, Radical Left Dems!
%
The DNC on Bernie Sanders, “Looks like they’re going to do it to him again, doesn’t it?”
%
I promised to restore hope in America. That includes the least among us.

%
We have a 'Positive Revolution' going on in America!
%
Iowa is a complete disaster for the Dems. They should bring in Mini Mike Bloomberg ASAP!
%
He directed the December desault.
%
Let me begin by wishing you a beautifew, look, look.
%
Democrats decided to sheild and shelter [gibberish], look, look.
%
The origins... how it... how it... started.
%
Unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.
%
Always remember, freedom unifies the soul.
%
The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a stank-tuary for criminal illegal immigrants.
%
When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them, it's not easy folks. I do my best.
%
I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotted deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my sons, and my whole family. And that includes Barron. That includes Barron. Who's up there as a young boy. [Melania was there, too.]
%
How much of this shit do we have to listen to? How much are we going to listen to?
%
Another win just in. Nervous Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress sued me, thrown out. This one unanimous, in the D.C. Circuit.
Witch Hunt!
%
They lost millions & millions of dollars, all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!
%
I think they should blame RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA again! If they can’t count votes properly, how are they going to run U.S. HealthCare?
%
We had the witch hunt that started from the day we came down the elevator. [It was an escalator...]
%
I don't know that other presidents would have been able to take it; some people said no, they wouldn't have.
%
If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already, many, many years.
%
You develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war. Much more so than, "Gee, let's have a normal situation."
%
I watched, this morning, as they tried to take credit for the stock market from... from... think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed.
%
People came to Washington to help other people -- bright-eyed and bushy tail, I say, they came, one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say.
%
Can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it.
%
And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today, never heard him use it before. But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president.
%
I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things. They're vicious and mean -- vicious, these people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person.
%
When [Nancy Pelosi] said, "I pray for the president, I pray for the" -- she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite.
%
I doubt [Nancy Pelosi] prays at all.
%
The Republican Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had that.
%
Many people were on the call. I know that many people -- they even have apprenti -- bringing up an old favorite word of mine, "The Apprentice" -- they have apprenti-- they have people on these calls. And I know there are many -- when I speak to the head of a nation -- and they have many people on.
%
We're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast.
%
Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius -- because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side -- maybe even more so, because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word, very ugly. They took nothing. 
%
I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called, "total acquittal."
%
People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys -- I mean, Nadler, I know him much of my life, he's fought me in New York for 25 years, I always beat him and I had to beat him another time and I'll probably have to beat him again because if they find that I happen to walk across the street and maybe go against a light or something, "let's impeach him."
%
But we're going to do the best we can and I have my Cabinet but the Cabinet is different, I appoint them, OK? I didn't see all of them helping so much. You know, they were running their -- their various bureaucracies, right?
%
You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln -- I wish he were here, I'd give him one hell of an introduction, right?
%
 When I first got to know him, Jim Jordan, when I first got to know Jim I said, "Huh, he never wears a jacket." What the hell's going on?" He's obviously very proud of his body... But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough, and I'm looking -- and I'm looking at those ears, and I say, "Those ears have something going on there."
%
A woman who became a -- so we have a couple of women that became stars -- you two. And I always liked the name of her -- you know, I liked the name Lesko. I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face, I saw that everything.
%
We saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was -- the doctor -- and I told him his wife -- I said, "She loves you." "Why do you say that?" Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn... she couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, "Not good. Listen, I'm going home now." But the doctor came in. The wife is like -- she was a total mess. She was really devastated.
%
And Steve Scalise -- I actually -- honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. You -- you weren't that good-looking. You look good now. He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is.
%
God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he? ... I'm really not a bad person.
%
All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldn’t understand anyway.....
%
This is the biggest political crime in American History, by far. SIMPLY PUT, THE PARTY IN POWER ILLEGALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION, IN ORDER TO CHANGE OR NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. Terrible!
%
Thought his boss, Cryin’ Chuck, would have forced him to vote against the Hoax. A Do Nothing Stiff!
%
They are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin in West Virginia. He couldn’t understand the Transcripts. Romney could, but didn’t want to!
%
The Dems are crazed, they will do anything. Honesty & truth don’t matter to them. They are badly wounded.
%
Governor Cuomo wanted to see me this weekend. He just canceled. Very hard to work with New York - So stupid. All they do is sue me all the time!
%
The only way to stop the crazed Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats “is for the Republican Senate to run an offense here”.
%
Nobody loves the Bible more than I do.
%
There is nobody that respects women more than I do.
%
I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. Nnot purposely, but I've done things wrong.
%
Punch him in the face.
%
We're doing a lot of things that are very good, including waste and fraud.
%
Countries with a powerful death penalty, with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem. That includes China.
%
Mini Mike is a short ball (very) hitter. Tiny club head speed.
%
TOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!
%
Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won’t!
%
I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats.
%
You know how the famous Concord is? Concord -- that's the same Concord that we read about all the time right? Concord. [The "shot heard 'round the world" happened in Concord MA, not NH]

Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. We are proud of you and the Great State of Kansas... [They represent Kansas City, Missouri.]
%
I hate to say this to you, we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in.
%
We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never. Not one.
%
On Tuesday I delivered my address on the State of the Union. And I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly. Mumbling. Mumbling. Wha. Ho. Ha.
%
I'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me.
%
People come up to me, they say, 'I want to thank you. My wife thinks I am a total loser, sir. She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks I'm just horrible. And the last three years, I'm up 94% sir. She thinks I'm a total genius when it comes to finance.'
%
Man, look at all that television back there. Whoa. That's -- that's bigger than those terrible Academy Awards I got to tell you. That used to be big, not so much anymore.
%
He actually looks better now than he did before he got shot, Steve Scalise.
%
Also a woman that not too many people know, very powerful, very smart, very beautiful even though I'm not allowed to say that because she's my daughter, Ivanka.
%
We're doing everything so it's great.
%
They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them. Watch your house go down in value. You ever see what happens? They build a windmill within distance of your house. You can forget about your house.
%
You want to see a bird graveyard? Go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. It's a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds, lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump.
%
Last month we ended the -- you saw last month being bye-bye. I say Donald J. Trump, bye-bye NAFTA.
%
And by the way, the virus. They're working hard. Looks like by April, you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away. [Nobody says that.]
%
It's called, you know, you ever hear of the thing -- you know with all the modern technology, all the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that. Two things never change. Right? A wheel and a wall.
%
Read The Snake, The Snake. Does anybody -- does anybody know what I'm talking about? [The author has asked Trump repeatedly to stop using it at his rallies.]
%
Actually I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They're doing it to you again, Bernie. They're doing it to you again.
%
We should impeach President Obama.
%
We're the hot party and we're the party with all the enthusiasm.
%
That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought. That swamp is a dirty swamp.
%
We have some really evil, dirty, horrible people.

We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We're very advanced.
%
By the way, they're going to take away everything. They're going to take away your wealth. They're going to take away your guns. They're going to take away everything.

I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women’s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!

Believe it or not, a long time ago I was told I have a great ear for music by somebody. I took a test, and they said, "Yes, he has a wonderful aptitude for music.

Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!
%
It is very important for our Country’s SECURITY that the United States Senate not vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution. We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness.
%
If my hands were tied, Iran would have a field day.

Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp!
%
A very bad night for Mini Mike!
%
Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out.
%
Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!
%
DRAIN THE SWAMP! We want bad people out of our government!
%
Mini Mike is a 5’4” mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. No boxes please. He hates Crazy Bernie and will, with enough money, possibly stop him. Bernie’s people will go nuts!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but can’t debate and has zero presence, you will see. He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb “Low Energy” Bush, but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini!
%
You know, now he wants a box for the debates, to stand on. Okay, it's okay, there's nothing wrong -- you can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, okay? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that?...Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?
%
It's a tough situation, but Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out -- paying for the wall, OK? You know they'd hit you with that. No, the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it's an advantage for Mexico too, when you think about it.

Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
%
So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr & Nellie, Steele & all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn't they lie? A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?

Years ago the Democrats had the money to build the Wall, but they didn’t have any idea how to get it done. I am building it bigger and better than ever thought possible!

IG report on Andrew McCabe: Misled Investigators over roll in news media disclosure
%
I would think that there have been many politicians -- I'm not one of them, by the way -- that have said a lot worse over the telephone.
%
I do make [William Barr's] job harder. I do agree with that. I think that's true.
%
I'm actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.
%
“They say Roger Stone lied to Congress.” 
@CNN
  OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?
%
Good luck in the debate tomorrow night and remember, no standing on boxes!

How bad were the Academy Awards this year, did you see? 'And the winner is ... a movie from South Korea!'

I'm looking for like, let's get 'Gone with the Wind' -- can we get like 'Gone with the Wind' back, please? 'Sunset Boulevard,' so many great movies.

I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at & mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!
%
Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!

Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!

I don't like it when they are criticizing these people and I don't like it.

Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances. Also, as mayor he was very bad under pressure - a choker!

Texas & Oklahoma: Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines. Petroleum based “anything” is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don’t vote for Mini Mike!
%
The American people know what’s going on, they totally get it.
%
I don't know what the time will be. I've heard very quick numbers, that of months. And I've heard pretty much a year would be an outside number. So I think that's not a bad range. But if you're talking about three to four months in a couple of cases, a year in other cases.
%
Well, I think that a 3.4% [mortality rate of the coronovirus] is really a false number. Now, and this is just my hunch, I think that number is very high. I think the number... personally I'd say the number is way under 1%
%
A lot of people will have this, and it's very mild. They'll get better very rapidly. They don't even see a doctor. They don't even call a doctor... so if we have thousands, or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work... some of them go to work. But they get better!
%
All these doctors say, 'how do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability, maybe I should have done this instead of running for president.
%
Anybody that wants a test can get a test. They're there. They have the tests. [Untrue at the time this was stated.]

%
I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.
%
So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake, OK? Inslee.
%
Let me just tell you: We have a lot of problems with the governor, the governor of Washington. ... So Mike may be happy with him, but I'm not.
%
If we came up with a cure right now and the outbreak was stopped in it's tracks, Inslee would say Trump did a terrible job.
%
I will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order, and he won’t even know he’s doing it!

There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!

This is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW!
%
Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election!
%
Mini Mike, “Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump, (and I failed miserably!).

This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of [Bloomberg's] life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!
%
Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!

So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn’t!
%
$700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!
%
Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!

But I think, importantly, anybody, right now and yesterday, that needs a test gets a test. They’re there, they have the tests, and the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test. [The tests were not yet available]

I understand that whole world. I love that world. I really do. I love that world. And you know what? The whole world is relying on us.

Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.

They would like to quarantine people. Now when they do that our numbers are going to go up.

I'll be making some decisions. I've already made some decisions, actually, today, but I'll be making some other ones that are very important
%
You know in April, supposedly, [coronavirus] dies with the hotter weather.
%
Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, [coronavirus] miraculously goes away. I hope that's true.
%
You know, a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat -- as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April.
%
The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.
%
In the other case [Ebola], it was a virtual 100%. With Ebola -- we were talking about it before -- you disintegrated. If you got Ebola, that was it.
%
[Coronavirus] is a flu. This is like a flu.
%
And again, when you have 15 people [with coronavirus], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.
%
I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don't think it's going to come to that, especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up. [Coronavirus infections were only going up, not down at this point.]
%
[Coronavirus] could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows. The fact is, the greatest experts -- I've spoken to them all. Nobody really knows.
%
[Coronavirus] will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.
%
Well, how many people die a year from the flu?' And, in this country, I think last year was 36- or 37,000 people. And I'm saying, 'Wow, nobody knew that information. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn't know that.
%
The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with. [Obama? He had nothing to do with this.]
%
They made some decisions which were not good decisions...We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult, but I'm not blaming anybody.
%
I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that. [There were 26,582 deaths.]
%
In a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down, without having to say 'shut down.' I mean, they're, to a certain extent, automatically shut down.
%
I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy.
%
Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is. [They can't.]
%
We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers "are lower than just about anybody. [Because it has only started...]
%
I think, you know, a lot of people are staying here and they're going to be doing their business here. And maybe that's one of the reasons the job numbers are so good. We've had a lot of travel inside the USA.
%
That wasn't our fault, and it wasn't the fault of the people on the ship, either. OK? It wasn't their fault either. And they're mostly Americans, so I can live either way with it. I'd rather have them stay on, personally. But I fully understand if they want to take them off.
%
You never blame yourself. You have to blame something else. If you do something bad, never, ever blame yourself.

WOW! Sleepy Joe doesn't know where he is, or what he's doing. Honestly, I don't think he even knows what office he's running for!

%
Prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.
%
[Please] remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.
%
If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!
%
I see they've canceled their big soccer games, their championship games and a lot of other games. They've canceled a lot over in Europe and all over the world. So this is a big world problem. [Donny finally waking up to reality.]
%
But it'll be -- [coronavirus will] go very quickly.
%
We'll be discussing some other moves that we're going to be making. And I think it's going to work out very well for everybody. [Including those who die from coronavirus?]
%
You know, you see what's going on. And so I just wanted that to stop as it pertains to the United States. And that's what we've done. We've stopped it. [No "we" didn't.]
%
And what is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me. Is it 32 deaths, Steve, around that? [38, but why wouldn't he know this already? Everyone else knew...]
%
I mean, think of it, the United States, because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. [38, but why wouldn't he know this already? Everyone else knew...]
%
Other countries, that are smaller countries, have many, many deaths. Thirty-two is a lot. Thirty-two is too many. But when you look at the kind of numbers that you're seeing coming out of other countries, it's pretty amazing, when you think of it.
%
We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. And we are -- we haven't -- I mean, I have it memorized, practically [all 192 pages], as to the powers in that act.
%
I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.
%
You have to remember, the stock market, as an example, is still much higher than when I got here. [83% of the gains are wiped out so far.]
%
We love the Irish.
%
People have -- you know, we call it cases, how many cases do you have.
%
Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned, OK?
%
Testing has been going very smooth.
%
We're doing it the opposite, we're very much ahead of everything.
%
Well, I think the Democrats won't be having rallies, but nobody showed up to their rallies anyway, so what difference does it make?
%
My rallies are very big. They're very big rallies.
%
I don't want people dying. That's what I'm all about.
%
So I had to make that decision, and frankly, the people that are professionals praise the decision, and it's something I had to do, and I think you'll see the end result is very good because of it. [The professionals have condemned his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.]
%
I used to be in the real estate business, as you've probably heard. They built some really -- and I -- I built beautiful buildings, and they've built some really beautiful buildings.
%
Some areas have no problem whatsoever, in our country, and others do. [44 states have coronavirus cases so far.]
%
You see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is -- which is good, frankly, it's the right thing. But it's not enforced, it's not very strong but people know they're -- they're being watched, New Rochelle, that's a hot spot.

They say Trump is getting rich off our nation. I lose billions being President, I don't care. It's nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions.

Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
%
I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested [for coronavirus].
%
No, I don't take responsibility [for the shortage of test kits] at all.

It's bad. It's bad. [Drumpf finally gets the seriousness of the Covid-19 situation.]
%
We have to fight that invisible enemy. [Drumpf finally gets the seriousness of the Covid-19 situation.]
%
I think [the Chinese] probably would agree with [the slur "Kung Flu"] 100%. It comes from China.
%
The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon!
%
15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD!
%
I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.
%
We will be invoking the Defense Production Act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is. And it can do a lot of good things if we need it.
%
I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning.
%
The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!
%
The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
%
Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
%
The “Times” is a disgrace to journalism!
%
We're going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought, and it will be a completely victory. It'll be a total victory. [Remember, he thought it would be a few *days*.]
%
When this virus is defeated, our great American economy will bounce back rapidly.
%
SOCIAL DISTANCING!
%
We are going to WIN, sooner rather than later!
%
I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!
%
Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help, America will WIN.
%
I want all Americans to understand: we are at war with an invisible enemy, but that enemy is no match for the spirit and resolve of the American people.
%
[Covid 19] cannot beat the LOVE, PATRIOTISM, and DETERMINATION of our citizens.
%
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall. Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night.
%
I will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!
%
Try what you can -- do the best you can to get what you can actually get.
%
I think it could be a game changer, and maybe not, and maybe not. But, I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful -- they're very powerful.
%
The federal government's not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk.
%
I cannot explain the gap, I'm hearing very good things on the ground.
%
This was something that happened that was -- some people would say an act of God. I don't view it as an act of God -- I would view it as something that just surprised the whole world.
%
It could have been stopped right where it came from, China, if we would have known about it. But now, the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible -- with this horrible virus, and it's too bad.
%
Let's see what happens, we have nothing to lose. You know the expression? What the hell do you have to lose. Okay?
%
[What do you say to Americans who are scared?] I say, you’re a terrible reporter.
%
[Dr Fauci said that there is no magic cure.] I disagree.
%
Yeah please, in the back? [pointing to Sean Spicer, whom Trump doesn't name.]
%
Coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists.
%
We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China.
%
We pretty much shut [Covid-19] down coming in from China. It's going to be fine.
%
CDC & my administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.
%
I think that's a problem that's going to go away. They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we're very close to a vaccine.
%
We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.
%
We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work and help our country.
%
CHINESE VIRUS FACT CHECK
%
I'm a smart guy. I feel good about it.
%
I've been right a lot.
%
Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?
%
I have to tell you, the throwing away of the masks, being in private business, the throwing away of the mask right away, they're throwing it away.
%
Nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we'd need tens of thousands of ventilators. [CDC said they would need 60,000 of them back in 2015]
%
WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
%
THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!
%
As long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you...and I will not stop until we win.
%
People are dying who have never died before.
%
What's the point of social distancing if 20% ignore the order?
%
Because [Covid-19] comes from China. It's not racist at all [to call it the Chinese Virus], no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate.
%
THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!
%
The Media is hopeless. Too bad!
%
The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy.
%
The Democrats want the Virus to win?
%
THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!
%
Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I've made a big deal. I think people understand it.
%
I am so happy I can barely speak. [Mitt Romney] may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO [Republican In Name Only], and I like him a lot!
%
We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.
%
Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government.
%
General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!  FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!
%
[Thomas Massie] is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!
%
So that's, you know, they -- they acted very, very late. They were incredibly late and the news, the media, I won't be a wise guy on your show and call it what a lot of people know it is. It's so unfair. It's so unfair.
%
It's -- it's incredibly powerful -- I mean, you can do almost anything as president. You can demand that they give you whatever you want, I mean all of these things.
%
Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one [ventilator] in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers.
%
Gov. (Jay) Inslee, that's the state of Washington. He was a failed presidential candidate. And you know, he's always complaining.
%
And your governor of Michigan, I mean, she's not stepping up. I don't know if she knows what's going on [with the Covid-19 pandemic].
%
And you know, you look around and you see what's going on.
%
The governor, he's a -- and he ran for president, didn't exactly do well. He got zero.
%
And you know a lot -- a lot of equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need but I'm building.
%
I don't understand Mitt Romney. I'm not a fan but, of course, I want him to get well, absolutely. [He tested negative.]
%
I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?
%
And it was also if you had [Spanish Flu], you had a very good percentage of not making it. You know, it was -- it was really something.
%
He's got a lot of ranting and raving and, you know, let's give everything away. But Bernie is not a bad debater.
%
Going last is much better because when you go first, and then they do it. So going last is much better.
%
But nevertheless, it got out there and I started calling it the Chinese virus. And everybody picked it up.
%
You can call [coronavirus] a germ. You can call it a flu. You can call it a virus.... I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is.
%
Look, don't be a cutie pie, OK? ... Nobody's ever done what we've done. Nobody's done anything like we've been able to do. And everything that I took over was a mess.
%
[Gretchen Whitmer] has no idea what's going on and all she does is say, 'Oh, it's the federal government's fault.'
%
I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter. I gave [coronavirus] two weeks.
%
A lot of equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need.
%
I'll never forget the day when a general came and said, 'Sir' -- my first week in office -- 'we have no ammunition.'
%
If they don't treat you right, I don't call.
%
The lamestream media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.
%
The media has really been fair.
%
I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen & the United Kingdom... however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!
%
2.2 million people would have died if we didn't do what we are doing. If we can hold that number down to 100,000, it's a horrible number, maybe even less ... we all, all together have done a very good job.
%
We're getting the word out. We're getting the accurate word out [on coronavirus].
%
Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn’t figured that out yet!
%
The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!
%
If you look at those individual statements [about coronavirus quickly disappearing on its own], they're all true: stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away. And it will go away. And we're going to have a great victory.
%
I know South Korea better than anybody. It's a very tight. Do you know how many people are in Seoul? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is? Thirty-eight million people. That's bigger than anything we have. [It's actually 10 million, with 26 million in the Seoul metropolitan region. Not 38 million. He's bragging about knowing something he clearly doesn't know.]
%
You know, I've gotten from fair people, you know, a lot of accolades. And I don't want the accolades, but it's just in terms of aa fact.
%
Then you hear Nancy Pelosi, who's, you know, somehow there's something wrong with the woman because she knows what we've done. And don't forget, she was playing the impeachment game. You know, her game where she ended up looking like a fool.
%
I want to talk to Germany. My father was born... you know, Germany is... it's in my heritage.
%
Somebody said to me today that wasn't in this particular world, they didn't know that we had that many countries. 151 countries. That's somethin'.
%
They've been delivering for years 10,000 to 20,000 masks. Ok, it's a New York hospital. Very... it's packed all the time. How do you go from 10,000 to 20,000 to 300,000? 10,000 to 20,000 masks, to 300,000. Even though this is different. Something's going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? I would like them to check that, because I hear stories like that all the time. ... I don't think it's hoarding. I think it's maybe worse than hoarding.
%
[Asked about criticism of his leadership when dealing with Covid-19] I think for the most part, I think they were saying thank you for doing such a great job.
%
I could cause panic much better than even you [Jim Acosta]. I could do much -- I would make you look like a minor league player.
%
Just stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.
%
It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing [with covid-19].
%
President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reiving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of 'The Bachelor.'
%
A lot of people were saying think of it as the flu, but it's not the flu is [Covid-19 is] vicious.
%
My hair is blowing around. And its mine. If there's one thing you can't get away with: if it's not yours, you have a problem.
%
I think I'm getting A+'s for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment, OK? ... But certainly, I guess, I thought of it and I think I probably acted -- I don't think I would have done any better [responding to coronavirus] had I not been impeached, OK?
%
This is easy to be negative about but I want to give people hope too. You know, I'm a cheerleader for the country.
%
It's an incredibly dark topic. An incredibly horrible topic. And it's incredibly interesting. That's why everybody is, they're going crazy, they can't get enough of coronavirus!
%
We lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off.
%
Some people frankly think they need them but they don't need [more ventilators].
%
My motto is: Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.
%
All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.
%
Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest—and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure. It's not your fault.
%
Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser.
%
You go to the hospital. You have a broken arm. You come out, you are a drug addict with this crap.
%
I was dealt a lot of bad hands.
%
It's an incredibly dark topic. An incredibly horrible topic. And it's incredibly interesting. That's why everybody is - it's - they're going crazy! They can't get enough of it.
%
You can use a scarf. A scarf is - everybody - a lot of people have scarves. You can use a scarf. A scarf would be very good... I would say "Do it!" but use a scarf. So, you can use scarves. Most people have scares, and scarfs are very good. And they can use a scarf. You can substitute a scarf for a mask. You can wear a scarf.
%
In many cases the scarf is better [than a mask against coronavirus]; it's thicker. I mean you can -- depending on the material, it's thicker.
%
This is a flu. This is like a flu. ... It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.
%
You know, [coronavirus] could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.
%
You call it germ, you can call it a flu. You can call it a virus. You can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody knows what it is.
%
I've known you for many years but I never knew how bad a Senator you are for the state of New York, until I became President.
%
They're doing tests on airlines -- very strong tests -- for getting on, getting off. They're doing tests on trains -- getting on, getting off. [Note: This is untrue.]
%
This will bring restaurants, and everything related, back - and stronger than ever. Move quickly, they will all be saved!
%
It wouldn’t matter if you got ten times what was needed, it would never be good enough. Unlike other states, New York unfortunately got off to a late start. You should have pushed harder. Stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going.
%
Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq.
%
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3500, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Positive impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
%
Get rid of those old, unsafe clunkers. Build better and safer American cars and create American jobs. Buy American!
%
Actually, other than her usual complaining that I’m a terrible person, [Nancy Pelosi] wasn’t bad. Still praying!
%
I stopped some very very infected, very very sick people.
%
When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.
%
If you buy a box of cereal — you have a voter ID.
%
If you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers), and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the 'invisible enemy.'
%
I've already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years.
%
I didn't say a date. ... I said [coronavirus is] going away, and it is going away.
%
You know in April, supposedly, [coronavirus] dies with the hotter weather. And that's a beautiful date to look forward to.
%
You know, a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat -- as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April.
%
Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, [coronavirus] miraculously goes away. I hope that's true.
%
Hydroxychloroquine, I don't know. It's looking like it's having some good results. I hope that would be a phenomenal thing. [Results haven't actually started coming in yet...]
%
I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen. I've heard about this for a long time, pandemics. You don't want pandemics.
%
We've done a job like nobody else.
%
I said [coronavirus is] going away and it is going away.
%
[When asked if he will be sending more ventilators to New York] No, they should have had more ventilators.
%
[Democrats] want mail in vote so they can cheat.. vote in person with VOTER ID.
%
[When asked if New York has enough face masks to get through next week] We're gonna find out.
%
My wife says I'm the biggest star in the world. But she might just be saying that because she's intelligent.
%
The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It's not a friend to freedom. It's not a friend even to the United States of America, where as all know, it has its home. And it surely isn’t a friend to Israel.
%
I have to start by saying I'm a big fan, a very big fan, of the United Nations and all it stands for... the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world, as far as I am concerned. So I am a big fan.
%
Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know.

I don’t know, all I know is what’s on the internet.

The bimbo [Megyn Kelly] back in town . I hope not for long .
%
Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.
%
I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.
%
An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.
%
I’ve always felt [Rosie O'Donell is] a degenerate.
%
We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on Coronavirus.
%
I ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman's [Andrew Jackson's] campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job.
%
The world is not doing well and we're going great.
%
It looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It's called the Pocahontas trap.
%
What do I know? I am not a doctor. But I have common sense.
%
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!
%
Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a “Virtual” Convention, one where he doesn’t have to show up. Gee, I wonder why? [Uhh, Covid-19?]
%
Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can’t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!
%
USA STRONG!
%
I only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt & dishonest so much of our Lamestream Media is.
%
Corrected Fake News!
%
Throughout the #Coronavirus Crisis, most of the media is doing what they do best: Looking bad.
%
We will use every possible resource to end this war and open our country again.
%
.@CNN is Fake News. They will take a good story and make it as bad as is humanly possible. They are a JOKE!
%
I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think that wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. I just don’t. Maybe I’ll change my mind.
%
[Wearing a face mask is] only a recommendation. You don’t have to do it.
%
They say take it. I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs.
%
We're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it. They called it wrong. They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. It's a great thing if it works but when they call every shot wrong that's no good.
%
He didn't have to be Ernest Hemingway. He made a mistake but he had a bad day. And I hate seeing bad things happen.
%
You said I said it was just like a flu. So the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu, and it was called -- you know that -- it was in 1917, 1918. And anywhere from 50 (million) to a hundred million people died. That was a flu. OK. So you could say that I said it was a flu, or you could say the flu is nothing to -- sneeze at.
%
You can't compare this [coronavirus] to 1918 where close to 100 million people died.
%
Can’t see AOC plus 3 supporting Sleepy Joe!
%
Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!
%
FLATTENING OF THE CURVE!
%
Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten.
%
The W.H.O. really blew it.
%
Hydroxychloroquine. Try it... if you like.
%
The Wall Street Journal always “forgets” to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are “through the roof”
%
You see what's going on with the bump, the hill, whatever you want to call it, it's really -- we're looking very good. [It's actually the worst in the world, by far.]
%
It would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country [when the coronavirus pandemic subsides].
%
You hate to say it [is safe to open the country post-coronavirus] too loudly because all of a sudden things don't happen, but I think we will be sooner rather than later.
%
I'd love to open with a big bang, one beautiful country, and just open. It's very possible.
%
I'm choosing not to [wear a face mask].
%
It's good, no, [Melania] feels that way. She likes the idea of wearing it, yeah, she does. A lot of people do. Again, it's a recommendation, and I understand that recommendation, and I'm OK with it.
%
You know what? I'll tell you, it does amaze me that President Obama hasn't supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened. When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? Why isn't he? He knows something that you don't know, that I think I know, but you don't know. So it'll be interesting.
%
Ask yourself, is Joe Biden ready to lead this country? Could he find his car in a three-tiered parking garage? Could he navigate a salad bar?
%
Sleepy Joe. He doesn't even know where he is or what he's doing or what office he's running for. Honestly, I don't think he knows what office he's running for. ... They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. ... They're going to be super-left, radical crazies. And Joe's going to be in a home and he'll be watching television.
%
Some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future. I really believe that.
%
What we'll be doing in the very near future is going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing. It's not necessary but it would be a good thing to have.
%
Other countries do it [covid-19 testing] but they do it in a limited form. We'll probably be the leader of the pack.
%
I'm a Christian!
%
I'm not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered, and they come in and they're dumped in a location, and then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you're going to win.
%
Staying at home leads to death also.
%
[Pointing to his head] That's my metrics. I'm going to have to make a decision [on when it'll be safe to reopen the country] and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make.
%
The germ has gotten so brilliant the antibiotics can't keep up with it.
%
Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. And this is their new hoax.

I was talking about what we're doing is under control, but I'm not talking about the virus.

I would love to have it open by Easter. Wouldn't it be great to have all the churches full?

Cryin’Chuck doesn’t have a clue. Couldn’t care less about the American Worker!

When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying “unnamed sources said”, or any such phrase where a person’s  name is not used, don’t believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don’t exist. They are made up to defame & disparage. They have no “source”...
%
The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!
%
I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?
%
“Whether he is right or wrong, it doesn’t matter. Criticize ’Trump’ for everything, and don’t let the public see Biden. Hide him.”
%
The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. 
%
For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!
%
The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The president of the United States calls the shots. They [state governments] can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States.
%
Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!

GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD. THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!

Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!
%
We're very close to completing a plan to open our country.
%
When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that's the way it's gonna be. It's total. It's total. And the governors know that. When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total.
%
I'll ask you some questions, because you're so guilty, but forget it.

Look, look. You know you're a fake. You know that? Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake.
%
The people are getting better [from Covid-19]. They're all getting better.
%
A lot. We did a LOT!
%
If they don't approve it, we're gonna go this route. We are going to do something that will be something I prefer not doing.
%
We will be the comeback kids, all of us, all of us. It's incredible, what's going on.
%
At this moment, nobody needs [ventilators]. We have to remember, during the [covid-19] surge, nobody's needed them for weeks now. But we'll have them for stockpiles.
%
We need ventilators, but now we're pretty well stocked. We really needed them.
%
Hospitals throughout the country currently have more than 60,000 unused ventilators.
%
If we're not happy, we'll take very strong action against a state or a governor if we're not happy with the job a governor is doing. We'll let them know about it. And as you know, we have very strong action we can take, including a close-down.
%
We have the right to do whatever we want, but we wouldn't do that, but no -- we would have the right to close down what they're doing if we want to do that. But we don't want to do that. And I don't think there'll be any reason to do that. But we have the right to do that. [No, "we" don't...]
%
This has never happened to China before. They never gave us 10 cents. Now they're paying us billions of dollars and we appreciate it.
%
Your Governor, Gretchen 'Half' Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn't have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA
%
Crazy Nancy Pelosi... is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician!
%
Crazy “Nancy Pelosi, you are a weak person. You are a poor leader. You are the reason America hates career politicians, like yourself.” @seanhannity She is totally incompetent & controlled by the Radical Left, a weak and pathetic puppet. Come back to Washington and do your job!
%
THANK GOD FOR TRUCKERS!
%
LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!
%
LIBERATE MICHIGAN!
%
LIBERATE MINNESOTA!
%
Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!
%
Why did the W.H.O. wait as long as it did to take decisive action?
%
Cuomo ridiculously wanted “40 thousand Ventilators”. We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty.
%
China wants Sleepy Joe sooo badly. They want all of those billions of dollars that they have been paying to the U.S. back, and much more. Joe is an easy mark, their DREAM CANDIDATE!
%
[Nancy Pelosi is a] incompetent political hack!
%
They are Fake News Losers!
%
The ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance.
%
Nervous Nancy is an inherently “dumb” person.
%
I've never seen so many American flags at a rally.
%
We're going to be safe. We have to be safe. And we don't want to close anything. We're not going to be closing. And we're starting to open our country.
%
In all fairness, governors could get [supplies for dealing with Covid-19] themselves. They really could. All of this.
%
So, you know, we had a great relationship with... we had a very bad relationship with China. Then we had a good relationship, because we made a great deal.
%
We cut it off. People were amazed. These gentlemen, everybody was amazed that I did it. We had 21 people in a room; everybody was against it but me ... I was very early.
%
I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.
%
I want Harvard to pay the money back, okay? If they won't do that, then we won't do something else.
%
I’ve had great “ratings” my whole life, there’s nothing unusual about that for me.
%
It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I’m really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!
%
Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as “nuts” as people are saying. He’s worse.
%
I love those people that use all of those things, the spas, the beauty parlors, barbershops, tattoo parlors, I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer.
%
So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just a very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn't been checked because of the testing. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that, too.
%
I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that. so that you're going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.
%
I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen.
%
So I said, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfect, I think would work. Maybe there’s something there.
%
I don't agree with [Dr. Fauci] on [the need for more covid-19 testing], no, I think we're doing a great job on testing.
%
Maybe you can, maybe you can't. Again I say maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. I'm like a person who has a good you-know-what... [pointing to head]
%
I'm just here to present talent. I'm here to present ideas because we want ideas to get rid of this [Covid-19] thing.
%
I don't know. I just read about one, but I also read many times good. So, I haven't at all.
%
Joe [Biden] is an easy mark.
%
Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus.
%
Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!
%
Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&T, which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP.
%
I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS!
%
Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
%
The Fake and totally corrupt News is after [St. Rep. Witsett] as a means of getting to me.
%
We saved many lives with our fast action on CoronaVirus!
%
As President, I am absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed.
%
I'm looking at this room and I see all this [people physical distancing] -- it loses a lot of flavor. It loses, to me, a lot of flavor.
%
I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax”, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with “one person from China”, and then grew, & will be a “Miracle” end!
%
I hope [Kim Jong Un is] OK.
%
What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!
%
I can only say this, I wish [Kim Jong Un] well. Good luck!
%
I've had a very good relationship with [Kim Jong Un].
%
I may [attempt to contact Kim Jong Un]. I just hope he's doing fine.
%
When will all of the “reporters” who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished “Nobles” so that they can be given.... ....to the REAL REPORTERS & JOURNALISTS who got it right. [You mean Pulitzer... and it's spelled NOBEL.]
%
When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back, especially since they were gotten under fraud? [You mean Pulitzer...]
%
For all of the great lawyers out there, do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast! [You mean Pulitzer...]
%
The people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
%
People with me are always stunned.
%
The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!
%
I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing?
%
Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. [Like that changes how stupid his questions were...]
%
Looks to me like it's going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie. Everyone else is fading fast!
%
I thought to refer to him as Sleepy Joe, because a lot of people wanted me to take the word ‘sleepy’ to something that rhymes with it. Does that make sense to you? And I thought it was too nasty.
%
FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
%
There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!
%
So true! [Replying to his own tweet. He probably upvoted it, too. Moron.]
%
[Washington Post] are one of the worst in the “news” business. Total slime balls!
%
[Slurred] I love everybody...
%
Obama's handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you're entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.
%
We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain.
%
Shifty is a crooked politician!
%
Many very good experts, very good people too, said [Covid-19] would never affect the United States. The experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong and a lot of people didn't know it would be this serious.
%
I think what happens is [Covid-19 is] going to go away. This is going to go away. And whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we'll be able to handle it.
%
There are big believers in testing, and then there are some governors that don't feel as strongly about it at all.
%
You go back, and you take a look at even professionals like Anthony were saying, 'This is no problem.' This was late in February. This is no problem. This is going to blow over. [Fauci never once even implied this.]
%
We can’t let the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?
%
If somebody else were in this position [president while Kim Jong Un is missing], we would’ve been right now at war with North Korea.
%
The Do Nothing Democrats!
%
Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision! [At this point, USA has 61,700 deaths.]
%
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC!
%
I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN “anchorman” Don Lemon, the “dumbest man on television”. Then you have Psycho Joe “What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?” Scarborough, another of the low I.Q. individuals!
%
DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY GOT CAUGHT!
%
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead.
%
[Brian Williams is] a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
%
Joe Biden forgot he's supposed to be lying about President Trump's coronavirus response – and he actually told the truth!
%
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
%
The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
%
I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don't think that they will put a man in who's incompetent.
%
China will do anything they can to have me lose this race.
%
I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was. I want to go back to where it was, that's where we're going to be.
%
I had one restaurant owner come up to me and said, 'Sir, you know I'm going to be opening up but if I distance too much I have 50 percent of the restaurant I had.' I said, 'And you'll also have a worse atmosphere.'

DIRTY COPS!
%
Our death totals, our numbers, per million people, are really very, very strong. We're very proud of the job we've done.
%
[Flynn] loves his son, as people often do.
%
[Accusations against Biden] could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I've been falsely charged numerous times.
%
I hate to be promoting AT&T, but @OANN is Great News, not Fake News. Everybody should be carrying them!
%
Honest Abe wasn’t bad.
%
She was thrown off The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now [Nicolle] Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!
%
I, for one, am glad to see [Kim Jong Un] is back, and well!
%
The Fake News doesn’t show real polls. Lamestream Media is totally CORRUPT, the Enemy of the People!
%
[George W. Bush] was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!
%
Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work!
%
Not much time to sleep.
%
The Impeachment Hoax will be exposed. Crazy Nancy gets Nothing Done, that’s why she got thrown out as Speaker the first time. Also, she should come back to Washington now!
%
The Russia Hoax is the biggest political scandal in American history. Treason!!! Lets see how it ends????
%
Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!
%
I have done more for farmers and ranchers than any President in history, and it has been my honor in doing so!
%
[The US Intelligence community] only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner [until late January]. [They were sounding the alarm since January 3rd, and Trump was still comparing it to the flu on March 9.]
%
You see demonstrations all over the country and those are meaningful demonstrations. It's big stuff. [ignoring the guns and anti-semitism]
%
[To a woman who lost her job due to Covid19] You'll get a job where you make more money, frankly, and I think that's going to happen.
%
I have a good feel for this stuff. I've done it for a long time.
%
We built the greatest economy in the world, the greatest economy, frankly, Bret, and you can correct me if you'd like, but you can't because it's fact -- the greatest economy that the world has ever seen.
%
Now we're going toward 50 -- I'm hearing, or 60,000 people [dying from Covid19]. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we're going toward 50 or 60,000 people.
%
Look, we're going to lose anywhere from 75,000, 80,000 to 100,000 people [to Covid19].
%
Now, I know a lot of people that had the flu. They were never in a coma. This is a very advanced -- this is a very horrible thing we're fighting.
%
This is a flu. This is like a flu.
%
You keep it -- you know, you keep the spread, you keep -- you stay away a certain amount.
%
We're the king of ventilators.
%
I mean, I could say I have had now essentially board meetings and meetings with governors and other people with, you know, using -- they call it tele, right, tele.
%
We we're winning bigger than we've ever won before, Bret.
%
Look, the biggest thing we can do to solve every problem is get rid of the plague. I call it the plague.
%
They always said Lincoln -- nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse. [Lincold was assassinated...]
%
We had the greatest tax cut, biggest tax cut in history.
%
When you look -- even if you look -- Space Force -- Space Force.
%
We also make all the ventilators.
%
And you're going to have [a covid19 vaccine] by the end of the year. I firmly believe it. I may be wrong.
%
We're all playing a very complicated game of chess or poker. Name whatever you want to name. But it's not checkers. That I can tell you. We have a very complicated game going.
%
I mean, everybody wants the rallies.
%
A group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago, then again 8 years ago, and then got BADLY beaten by me, a political first timer, 4 years ago, have copied (no imagination) the concept of an ad from Ronald Reagan...
%
I don’t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad.
%
Crazed Rick Wilson lost for Evan “McMuffin” McMullin (to me).
%
Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems, and now California, get this, doesn’t want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President.
%
Omar is a disaster who wants much higher taxes, hates our Military & our Vets, demands Open Borders, and is fighting to take away our great 2nd Amendment.
%
Getting great reviews, finally, for how well we are handling the pandemic.
%
Thank you very much to our beautiful “boaters.” I will never let you down!
%
I think you can really have it both ways.
%
I BEAT THEM ALL!
%
The Democrats want us to fail so they can win an election which they’re not going to win
%
In every battle, we have placed our loyalty in each other & God - we have prevailed, and we will prevail again!
%
The Fake News has reached an all time high!
%
After having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests. [How could Obama have gotten tests for Covid19?]
%
I have heard that they are loaded up with gowns now. We had empty shelves and empty nothing because it wasn't put there by the last administration.
%
This is really the worst attack we've ever had. This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this.
%
I'm really in charge of [Operation Warp Speed]. I think probably more than anything I'm in charge.
%
Well, justice getting done is the thing that solves that problem.
%
So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.
%
Jeff Sessions was a disaster. I made him -- I didn't want to make him attorney general but he was the first senator to endorse me so I felt a little bit of an obligation.
%
[Jeff Sessions]  goes in -- he was so bad in his nomination proceedings. I should have gotten rid of him there.
%
I'm very happy for General Flynn. He was a great warrior, and he still is a great warrior, now in my book is an even greater warrior.
%
I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was.
%
I don't think you need that kind of testing or that much testing, but some people disagree with me and some people agree with me.
%
Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time, and then all of the sudden today she tested positive. This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great.
%
[Re: video of Pence delivering empty boxes] More Fake News, this time from Jimmy Kimmel’s last place show!
%
The biggest political crime in American history, by far!
%
We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic
%
[Re: the reopening of Trump Golf in Los Angeles] So great to see our Country starting to open up again!
%
Why is it that all of the political pundits & consultants that I beat so easily & badly, people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth, have become so totally “unhinged” when it come to your favorite President, me. These people are stone cold crazy!
%
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
%
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
%
In a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.
%
Here we go again. But they think they're doing it because it'll hurt me, the longer it takes to — hurt me in the election, the longer it takes to open up.
%
Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world, and maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me. Ask China that question, ok? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.
%
[Re: What crime Trump is accusing Obama of committing] You know what the crime is. The crime is obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.
%
THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. Sadly, our Lamestream Media is TOTALLY CORRUPT!
%
Because it was OBAMAGATE, and he and Sleepy Joe led the charge. The most corrupt administration in U.S. history!
%
OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!
%
This is why it’s not really the Lamestream Media, it’s the Rigged Media....and it is what I’m up against. It was corrupt in 2016. Now it is much more corrupt, and what you are seeing is the least of it....but WE WILL WIN AGAIN!
%
He got caught, OBAMAGATE!
%
OBAMAGATE!
%
We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn’t have a clue!
%
I don't want to wear a mask because it would make me look ridiculous.
%
Remember this, every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus, and I am happy for them all, could in no way have gotten those numbers, or had that success, without me and the Federal Governments help.
%
So interesting to see all of these people I beat so badly, pundits & consultants that never had a chance, telling me how to run for office.
%
The American People are WARRIORS!
%
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS
%
96% APPROVAL RATING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THANK YOU! We will win against a tired, exhausted man, Sleepy Joe Biden, in November.
%
Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don’t blame them!

When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn’t it obvious? What’s happening now? A total nut job!
%
Ratings way down, [Bill Maher's] show sucks!
%
Sleepy Eyes fails again!
%
Fake Journalists!
%
Crazy Nancy would be a total disaster, and the USA will never be a Communist Country!
%
Let's take a closer look at that birth certificate. @BarackObama was described in 2003 as being "born in Kenya."
%
If I decide to run for president, I will release my tax returnes. Absolutely.
%
One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands.
%
Every other President let China do whatever they wanted.
%
If I were a Senator or Congressman, the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR, is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk!
%
Thank you to all of those very brilliant Voters.
%
I don’t know the so-called Whistleblower Rick Bright, never met him or even heard of him, but to me he is a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government!
%
We just made a great Trade Deal, the ink was barely dry, and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference - and all those innocent lives lost!
%
When the so-called “rich guys” speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?
%
Obama was always wrong!
%
I call it the super duper missile.
%
The Dems are vicious, but got caught. They MUST pay a big price for what they have done to our Country. Don’t let them get away with this!
%
The Republicans must play by the same rules, or die!
%
Watch flunky @Lawrence CRY when I whipped his mind & he was FORCED to apologize to me over Apprentice fees. Even Psycho Cold Case Joe Scarborough (bad ratings) beat him up, on air, unmercifully. Find tapes & play (5 years back?).
%
I’m not running against Sleepy Joe Biden. He is not even a factor. Never was, remember 1% Joe? I’m running against the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats & their partner, the real opposition party, the Lamestream Fake News Media! They are vicious & crazy, but we will WIN!
%
We’ve done a GREAT job on Covid response, making all Governors look good, some fantastic (and that’s OK)
%
I made everybody look good, but me!
%
Always hearing bad, made up numbers on how badly I’m doing. Lamestream Media is unhinged and CORRUPT!
%
“FAKE NEWS IS NOT ESSENTIAL!”
%
Likewise, the @nytimes and @washingtonpost are a disgrace to journalism. They are all Fake News, and they know it better than anyone else.
%
History is unfolding, and it is not a pretty picture for “journalism”.
%
Where is the 302? It is missing. Was it stolen or destroyed? General Flynn is being persecuted! #OBAMAGATE
%
Thank you to all of my great Keyboard Warriors. You are better, and far more brilliant, than anyone on Madison Avenue (Ad Agencies). There is nobody like you!
%
American workers are the best in the world!
%
I haven't seen Mike Pence. And I miss him.
%
People have birth certificates. [Obama] doesn't have a birth certificate. Now, he may have one, but there's something on that births.. maybe religion, maybe it says he's a Muslim. I don't know.
%
I love the poorly educated.
%
When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn't do any testing we would have very few cases.
%
People are dying who have never died before.
%
Doing REALLY well, medically, on solving the CoronaVirus situation (Plague!). It will happen!
%
Prior to the Plague floating in from China, our Economy was blowing everybody away, the best of any country, EVER.
%
And we can sell beef. It's peanuts.

Ted Cruz, I don't know if he likes me.

[Obama]  was an incompetent president - grossly incompetent.  That’s all I can say.

Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back.

[Mitt Romney] LOSER!
%
REOPEN OUR COUNTRY!
%
Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about [taking hydroxychloroquine].

These people are sick. Pelosi has got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems. We're dealing with people who have to get their act together for the good of the country.

I get exercise. I mean I walk, I this, I that. I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think.

I think that when somebody pays us a fortune for arms, we should get the deal done, I will tell you that.

I don't respond to [Nancy Pelosi], I think she's a waste of time.
%
Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!

Sleepy Joe has given you nothing, and never will!

We call it the problem that came in, and the problem that beset us. We were all of a sudden we were surprised by this.

[Norman Vincent Peale, "God's Salesman"] thought I was his greatest student of all time.

I had [a mask] on before, I wore one on in this back area. I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.

China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!
%
It all comes from the top. [China] could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!
%
What I want to do is get the churches open. The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors.
%
I had [a mask] on before. But I didn't want to give the press the pleasure. I think it sets an example both ways.
%
Sleepy Joe cannot bring us to greatness. He is the reason I’m here!
%
.@deanbaquet is to be seriously respected. He has long been considered one of the dumbest men in the world of journalism, and he became Executive Editor of the Failing New York Times. Not easy to do.
%
[Dean Baquet] laughs at his boss, Publisher A.G. Sulzberger, and I laugh at them all.
%
Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor
%
No Voter Fraud!
%
We don't want to destroy this country. We're going to make it bigger, better, greater than ever before.
%
A blow to her head? Body found under his desk? Left Congress suddenly? Big topic of discussion in Florida...and, he’s a Nut Job (with bad ratings). Keep digging, use forensic geniuses!
%
You should drop out of the race & pray that super liberal @DougJones, a weak & pathetic puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi & Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, gets beaten badly.
%
Schools in our country should be opened ASAP. Much very good information now available.
%
It was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. I was left a MESS!
%
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS! Get ready, it is already happening again!
%
Sleepy Joe’s representatives have just put out an ad saying that I went to play golf (exercise) today.
%
Barack was always playing golf, doing much of his traveling in a fume spewing 747 to play golf in Hawaii
%
So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office, hit her head on his desk, & die? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that?
%
I'm also standing with President Xi, he's a friend of mine.
%
The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought
%
In 2016 when Joe & his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking about whether or not Joe coldhave done such a horrible thing? Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I know him well, far better than most.
%
I just keep rolling along, doing great things
%
Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi.
%
There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.
%
Joe Biden’s handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster.
%
Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen! [Re: Fact checking links added to tweets where Trump lies.]
%
Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.
%
OBAMAGATE MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE SMALL POTATOES!
%
The Radical Left Lamestream Media, together with their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats, are trying to spread a new narrative that President Trump was slow in reacting to Covid 19. Wrong, I was very fast
%
Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!
%
Nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful USA!
%
Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win.
%
Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!
%
Think of the absolute worst things you can say about Donald J. Trump, pretend there are sources, and just say it.
%
The Transition to Greatness has started, ahead of schedule.
%
The radical left is in total command and control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google.
%
This is infinity here. It could be infinity. We don't really don't know. But it could be. It has to be something — but it could be infinity, right?
%
They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!
%
I said, 'Hey, we've done the moon. That's not so exciting.' So we'll be doing the moon. But we'll really be doing Mars.
%
We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000.
%
This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!
%
So many different viewpoints! [reply to a retweet saying Image of Biden in black mask endorses culture of silence, slavery, and social death.]
%
New papers make CLEAR that the Obama Administration SPIED, in an unprecedented manner, on the Trump Campaign and beyond, and even on the United States Senate.
%
Who else gave the less than elite (We are the elite. We know how to WIN!) 260 great new Federal Judges, 2 SCJ’s, Low Taxes, biggest ever REG. CUTS, Rebuilt Military, Choice, saved 2A & MUCH more? Not Sleepy Joe!
%
Big win in Texas on the dangerous Mail In Voting Scam! [They're being forced to vote in person in Texas.]
%
All over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad “gift” from China, marches on. Not good!
%
So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid
%
Our election process will become badly tainted & a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater @yoyoel
%
Imagine if your local phone companies tried to edit or censor what you said. Social media companies have far more power.
%
REVOKE 230!
%
CHINA!
%
What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff, and so many others, on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus, Plus, Plus? What about China’s propaganda? WHO’s mistakes? No flags?
%
Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.....
%
MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION.
%
These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.

[Lockdown is] going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.

I just got back from India, right? I just beat Covid.

When you say per capita, there’s many per capitas. Is this like per capita relative to what?

How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats?

Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???

Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. “We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and good practice.”

The problem is people that get the [HIV] test, that test positive, they go out on a rampage on purpose.
%
This is the flu. And it's a bad flu season perhaps, although it hasn't even started yet. But it's a bad flu season, perhaps. And maybe it won't be. But I do think we shouldn't be over-reacting.
%
I think the vaccines can be very dangerous. And obviously, you know, a lot of people are talking about vaccines for children with respect to autism.
%
But as far as you know, giving supplies and providing medical supplies, I'm all for that. And even if doctors want to go there and help, I think I'm all for that too. But you know, they do have to suffer consequences.
%
I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.
%
Here we go again. Fake News @CNN is blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. They are sick losers with VERY bad ratings! P.S. Can’t blame China because they need the cash?
%
It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don’t lay the blame on others!
%
By the way, they love African-American people, they love black people. MAGA loves the black people.
%
You know what solves it? When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster? Then you'll have a ... you know... you'll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.
%
When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.'
%
When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody, don’t hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' I have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they've been made to protect the criminal. Totally made to protect the criminal.
%
You're not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work... Just like they don't want to have rich people at the head of treasury.
%
If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise.
%
I'd like to punch [that protester] in the face, I'll tell you.
%
You're probably right. [18-year old Lindsay Lohan] is probably deeply troubled, and therefore great in bed. How come the deeply troubled women... you know, deeply, deeply troubled... they're always the best in bed. You don't want to be with them for the long term, but for the short term there's nothing like it.
%
The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.

Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own [13 year old] daughter than your wife?

The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA [but not the Proud Boys or KKK] as a Terrorist Organization.
%
You can’t be #1 on Earth if you are #2 in space.

In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first.
%
Much more “disinformation” coming out of CNN, MSDNC, @nytimes and @washingtonpost, by far, than coming out of any foreign country, even combined. Fake News is the Enemy of the People!
%
When I saw the policeman run past the mayor, who I think is probably a very good person, a radical left mayor, when I saw the policeman running out of a police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life. Never seen anything so bad, and then see them trying to justify it.
%
My administration will stop mob violence, and stop it cold.
%
I don't feel that as a G7 it properly represents what's going on in the world. It's a very outdated group of countries.
%
We already heard how Donald Drumpf (stupid name) listened to Philonise. This new reality show will be truly entertaining.
It's like rewriting the movie Being John Malkovitch with an all new cast of one.
%
Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places.
%
Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.
%
NOVEMBER 3RD.
%
LAW & ORDER!
%
The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!
%
(thank you President Trump)
%
[The Secret Service] were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn’t have felt more safe.
%
It’s almost like the United States has no President.
%
We are a rudderless ship heading for a major disaster. Good luck everyone!
%
You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people.
%
I am your president of law and order.
%
[The American governors] must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.
%
If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.
%
You have to dominate. If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time – they're going to run over you, you're going to look like a bunch of jerks.
%
I wish we had an occupying force.
%
We're going to clamp down very, very strong," Trump said. "The word is 'dominate.' If you don't dominate your city and your state, they're gonna walk away with you. And we're doing it in Washington, in DC, we're going to do something that people haven't seen before ... But we're going to have total domination.
%
Most of you [governors] are weak.
%
You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff [protesting and looting] again.
%
I will fight to protect you. I am your President of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters.
%
The whole world was laughing at Minneapolis over the police station getting burned.
%
D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).
%
My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.
%
...AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
%
New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD.
%
SILENT MAJORITY!
%
NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!
%
The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo’s ratings are down 50%!
%
Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about. His nickname was 'Chaos', which I didn't like, & changed it to 'Mad Dog.'
%
I didn't like [Jim Mattis'] 'leadership' style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!
%
[On only 36% of black Americans trusting police] Well, I think it's a very sad problem. As you know, as a Republican I'm doing very well with African-Americans and with the vote, with the.. in polls and everything.. especially, I mean I haven't seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China, so that changed things up, but we had the best econoomy ever.
%
[On only 36% of black Americans trusting police] It's interesting. I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket - a tremendous program that culminated on that day and obviously it goes from there. But I then made a speech, and it was a speech about the rocket.
%
I would love to not even bother with social media, but I'm able to get my word out beautifully by social media. Fortunately.
%
I saw today, [Biden] took his mask off for the first time in a while. I haven't seen his face for a long time, and he said, 'I think we should do this' or 'I think we should do that.' And actually then he started speaking through the mask again. He feels comfortable with the mask on, I think.
%
I've done so much for religion.
%
.@MayorBowser is grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C.
%
...We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!
%
The Pastor is a winner and a great guy.
%
The Lamestream Media is out of control. It would be impossible to fully explain how dishonest they are!
%
Don’t wait until after U.S. Election to make the Big deal. I’m going to win. You’ll make a better deal now!
%
The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for “handouts”, is now fighting with the National Guard, who saved her from great embarrassment. over the last number of nights. If she doesn’t treat these men and women well, then we’ll bring in a different group of men and women!
%
The only one that can kill this comeback is Sleepy Joe Biden!
%
Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that's happening for our country [that the economy is coming back "like a rocket ship"]. This is a great day for him. It's a great day for everybody.
%
[Retweeted] The fact that (Floyd) has been held up as a martyr sickens me.
%
You have a governor that doesn't know what she's doing, and she's like a dictator, you know?
%
I want LAW & ORDER!
%
Not only will Sleepy Joe Biden DEFUND THE POLICE, but he will DEFUND OUR MILITARY! He has no choice, the Dems are controlled by the Radical Left.
%
Colin Powell, a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars, just announced he will be voting for another stiff, Sleepy Joe Biden.
%
Unlike Senator Manchin, Big Jim Justice was very loyal to your favorite President during Pelosi’s Impeachment Scam.
%
This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country’s recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!
%
The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!
%
If I wasn’t constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations, Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Hoax, I’d be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair, but it is what it is!!!
%
Enough with Omar, you’ll have nothing left!
%
THE REAWAKENING OF AMERICA!
%
Mattis was our Country’s most overrated General. He talked a lot, but never “brought home the bacon.” He was terrible!
%
Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANFIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment... I watched... Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?
%
Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!
%
Seriously failed presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars. 
%
Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game.
%
The Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do.
%
THOSE THAT DENY THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT!
%
Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. “A walk in the park”, one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, & S.S. GREAT JOB! [Yea, he is calling Secret Service the SS now...]
%
...And the Trump family didn’t ask the Federal government for money to carry this and many other very expensive to carry properties! [Still bragging about being rich instead of actually getting any work done...]
%
[The Trump] Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations...
%
The Radical Left Democrats: First they try to take away your guns. Then they try to take away your police!
%
People have no idea how Fake the Lamestream Media is!
%
President @realDonaldTrump has been fighting for the forgotten men & women of America since day one.
%
Together we are keeping AMERICAN WORKERS employed!
%
We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear. But we'll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racist.
%
There has been vigorous conversation on how to ensure fairness, equality, and justice for all—but sadly, some are only trying to stoke political division.
%
Melania really wanted to be with us, really. [He didn't notice she was standing right beside him.]
%
Think about it as a celebration. My rally is a celebration. Don't think about it as an inconvenience.
%
The ramp that I descended after my West Point Commencement speech was very long & steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery. The last thing I was going to do is “fall” for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum!
%
[American company] Concast is known for its terrible service. On top of that they provide FAKE NEWS on MSDNC & @NBCNews. Drop them and go to a good provider!
%
THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!
%
How. Stupid. Are we?
%
The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters & Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies.
%
We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic...
%
Biden can't do it. He doesn't know he's alive.
%
[Hilary Clinton] could be crazy. She could actually be crazy.
%
To defeat crime and radical Islamic terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina.
%
Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country
%
The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters & Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won’t work!
%
Many Democrats want to Defund and Abolish Police Departments. HOW CRAZY!
%
DRAIN THE SWAMP! VOTE EARLY!
%
Any conversation with me is classified.
%
If he wrote a book, I can't imagine that he can, because that's highly classified information. Even conversations with me -- they're highly classified. I told that to the attorney general before. I will consider every conversation with me as president highly classified. So that would mean that if he wrote a book, and if the book gets out, he's broken the law.
%
I haven't asked anybody [whether the state governors agree to open up during Covid-19 pandemic]. You know why? Because I don't have to.
%
We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment & everything else.
%
Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?
%
Oh, are you [England] a nuclear power?
%
[Venezuela] is really part of the United States.
%
Arrest the reporters, force them to serve time in jail, and then demand they disclose their sources.
%
If you look at the polls, we're way ahead of sleepy Joe in terms of enthusiasm. We have enthusiasm like they have never seen before, actually. And Joe has the lowest, I hear, enthusiasm on record.
%
I don't even like to talk about [10 states reporting their highest number of Covid-19 cases ever], because it's fading away. It's going to fade away.
%
These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.
%
I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous. It's actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it. Very few people have heard of it. Actually, a young African American Secret Service agent knew what it was. I had political people who had no idea.
%
[After saying nobody had heard of Juneteenth] Oh, really? We put out a statement? The Trump White House put out a statement [last year]?
%
The fact that I'm having a rally on that day [Juneteenth] -- you can really think about that very positively as a celebration. Because a rally to me is a celebration. It's an interesting date. It wasn't done for that reason, but it's an interesting date.
%
George Washington was a slave owner. Are we going to take down statues of George Washington?
%
I went to West Point over the weekend, made a very good speech, according to everybody. They said the speech was one of the best. The kids thought it was one of the best they'd ever heard. Stood up there for a long time saluting. Were you there?
%
he led me to a ramp that was long and steep and slippery. And I said, I got a problem because I wear, you know, the leather bottom shoes. I can show them to you if you like. Same pair. And you know what I mean, they're slippery. I like them better than the rubber because they don't catch. So they're better for this. But they're not good for ramps. I said, General, I got a problem here. That ramp is slippery.... So I'm going to go real easy. So I did. And then the last 10 feet I ran down. They always stop it just before I ran, they always stop it. ... If you would have seen this ramp, it was like an ice skating rink. So I'm the only one that can happen.
%
I spent three hours on stage, the sun pouring in and I saluted 1,106 cadets, and that's not easy. Even the general said, That's amazing. Other presidents would never have been able to do it.
%
I stayed there for hours. And what do I do? I get publicity about walking down a ramp. And does he have Parkinson's? I don't think so.
%
Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!
%
I have done FAR more than any President in first 3 1/2 years!
%
If the Dems get in, our Country is in big trouble!
%
“THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.”
%
Think of it: With a pandemic, and with one of the worst things that's ever happened, we -- our country has never lost 105,000 people. Whether it's World Trade Center, which was 2,900, or Pearl Harbor, which was less than that, we've never lost anything close to this.
%
Why did they block [the coronavirus] from leaving Wuhan but they didn't block it from going to the rest of the world, including the United States? Why is that? Beijing doesn't have it; other places don't have it.
%
Well, they're not protesters. They're supporters of me... [they were anti-trump protesters]
%
But in California, the governor sent, I hear -- or is sending -- millions of ballots all over the state. Millions. To anybody. To anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals. Anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot.
%
But when they send out -- like in California -- millions and millions of ballots to anybody that's breathing -- anybody in California that's breathing, gets a ballot.
%
Take a look at who they're polling, if they poll anybody, because I don't even think they go out and poll. I think they sit at a desk and say, give this number, give that number.
%
[Trump supporters at the Tulsa rally] can wear [masks] or not. I want them to be happy.
%
Here's the bad part ... when you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people; you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people, Slow the testing down please. They test and they test… we’ve got another one over here! The young man’s ten years old, he’s got the sniffles, he’ll recover in about 15 minutes. It’s a case!
%
Hey look, so far tonight I'm average.
%
Joe Biden’s record can be summed up as 4 decades of betrayal, calamity and failure — he NEVER did ANYTHING!

[Bolton] likes dropping bombs on people, and killing them. Now he will have bombs dropped on him!

[Bolton] must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him. This should never to happen again!!!

We’ve never had an empty seat & we certainly won’t in Oklahoma! [The rally had less than 6200 participants, despite room for 21000 and claims of 1 million tickets spoken for.]

Our people are not nearly as violent. But if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side.
%
They want to demolish our heritage!
%
Our country will be destroyed!
%
President Obama gave them 150 billion dollars for nothing, and almost more incredibly, he gave him $1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they're not doing so well, are they? They're not doing so well.
%
It's one o'clock in the morning, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman, whose husband is away, as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911, and they say, 'I'm sorry this number is no longer working.'
%
Does anybody honestly think he controls these radical maniacs? He will surrender your country to these mobsters.

If the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe.

When you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms.
%
[Democrat voters] are stone-cold crazy!

We ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. You know, they talk about freedom of speech, and I believe in freedom of speech. But that's desecration.

I put tariffs on China, which are far worse than any sanction you can think of.

Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended.
%
We voted during World War One & World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!
%
I gave John Bolton, who was incapable of being Senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko, and was not liked, a chance. I always like hearing differing points of view. He turned out to be grossly incompetent, and a liar.

MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS.

... we built something so strong that we are now setting economic growth records again.

A Democrat win in 2020 would be a tragic setback for African Americans!

[Mary Trump's] not allowed to write a book. You know, when we settled with her and her brother, who I do have a good relationship with, she's got a brother, Fred, who I do have a good relationship with, but when we settled, she has a total... signed a nondisclosure.
%
They test and they test. We have tests [for the coronavirus] that people don't know what's going on.
%
I personally think testing is overrated, even though I created the greatest testing machine in history.
%
You are warriors. We had some very bad people outside [the Tulsa arena]. They were doing bad things. But I really do appreciate it. [There was actually nothing whatsoever happening. The crowd to see Trump was pitifully small, even though many of them were paid to be there.]
%
We're going to be in Oklahoma. And it's a crowd like, I guess, nobody's seen before. We have tremendous, tremendous requests for tickets like, I think, probably has never happened politically before.
%
The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable. The crowds are unbelievable. They haven't seen anything like it. [There was no crowd. The venue was 3/4 empty.]
%
There's nothing to be embarrassed about [assaulting a reporter]. Any guy who can do a body slam, he's my guy.
%
We did a great job on CoronaVirus, including the very early ban on China, Ventilator production, and Testing, which is by far the most, and best, in the World. We saved millions of U.S. lives.!
%
There will never be an “Autonomous Zone” in Washington, D.C., as long as I’m your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!
%
Washed up Creepster John Bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail, money seized, for disseminating, for profit, highly Classified information.
%
See, Bolton broke the law. Classified Information!
%
Interesting guy. “Bolton is really dumb”.  True, and he broke the law!
%
We've never had an empty seat, and we definitely won't in Oklahoma!
%
The choice in two twenty is simple!
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement.
%
It is ashame that Congress doesn’t do something about the lowlifes that burn the American Flag. It should be stopped, and now!
%
You know, in the good old days, if you had a traitor, you know what you would do? You would just line them up in the street and have them shot.
%
Is James Comey and his band of Dirty Cops going to apologize to General Michael Flynn (and many others) for what they have done to ruin his life?
%
What about Robert Mueller and his Angry Democrat Cronies - Are they going to say, SO SORRY?
%
I think you're going to have a big surprise, a beautiful surprise, sooner than anybody would think. [Speculating that Coronavirus is going away already in June, when evidence shows that it is greatly increasing.]
%
They're tearing down statues, desecrating monuments and purging dissenters. It's not the behavior of a peaceful political movement, it's the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don't love our country -- they don't love our country.
%
Now they are looking at Jesus Christ, they are looking at George Washington, they're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen, not going to happen while I'm here. [Trump lying to incite moral panic yet again.]
%
One of the things that will be really great -- the word experience is still good, I always say talent is more important than experience, I've always said that -- but the word experience is a very important word, a very important meaning.
%
I mean, the man [Joe Biden] can't speak. And he's going to be your president because some people don't love me, maybe.
%
The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING
%
Failed presidential candidate (thank you President Trump!), Carly Fiorina, said she will be voting for Corrupt Joe Biden. She lost so badly to me, twice in one campaign, that she should be voting for Joe.
%
The Fake News and phony Fake Suppression Polls have never been worse. The Lamestream Media has gone CRAZY!
%
Thank you to the great people of The Villages. [re: video of man in a golf cart with Trump posters is chanting "White Power!"]
%
The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall. Corrupt Joe is shot.
%
Now, he's already saying that he can't do debates because of Covid. Do you believe it? [Biden has officially committed to the 3 debates and never even hinted at avoiding them.]
%
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
%
Nobody wants a Low IQ person in charge of our Country, and Sleepy Joe is definitely a Low IQ person!
%
Covid... Covid-19... Covid. I say, "What's the 19? Covid-19?" Some people can't explain what the 19. Give me the... Covid-19. I said, "That's an odd name."
%
Sorry to inform the Do Nothing Democrats, but I am getting VERY GOOD internal Polling Numbers.
%
People want LAW, ORDER & SAFETY!
%
Hey, it's 1 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I’ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, 'I'm sorry, this number’s no longer working.'
%
I notice everything.
%
THE LONE WARRIOR!
%
So far we're not doing too well. We've had a lot of losses with a court that was supposed to be in our favor.
%
NYC is cutting Police $’s by ONE BILLION DOLLARS, and yet the @NYCMayor is going to paint a big, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign on Fifth Avenue, denigrating this luxury Avenue.
%
Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won’t let this symbol of hate [a Black Lives Matter sign] be affixed to New York’s greatest street.
%
Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won’t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York’s greatest street. [Trump seemingly doesn't realize the police can't go against the mayor's wishes. What does he know about politics?]
%
As I watch the Pandemic spread its ugly face all across the world, including the tremendous damage it has done to the USA, I become more and more angry at China. People can see it, and I can feel it!
%
I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. Okay. I thought it was okay. It was a dark black mask, and I thought it looked okay. It looked like the Lone Ranger. I have no problem with that, and if people feel good about it, they should do it.
%
Thank you very much, Tim Apple.
%
We are putting out that life because it’s a bad life that we’re talking about.
%
We're headed back in a very strong fashion. ... And I think we're going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that at some point that's going to sort of just disappear. I hope.
%
What we've done nobody's been able to do. But we have more to do.
%
We made the great deal with China. Of course, as I said, the ink wasn't dried before we got hit with the China plague. But we made the deal.
%
We have many great trade deals. Our country will be so strong.
%
We have to make our own things.
%
I never did this before, never slept over in Washington.
%
What we've done nobody's been able to do. But we have more to do.
%
At the end of our first term, it's going to be great. It would have been phenomenal. We got hit with the plague.
%
We want to build our own ships.
%
I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats.
%
You'll see things that you would not have believed are possible.
%
In the fields and jungles of Vietnam, they delivered a swift and swipvian, you know that sweeping. It was swift and it was swweeping like nobody's ever seen anything happen. A victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one.
%
The Fake News Media is being laughed at all over the world!
%
Anybody need any Ventilators???
%
I just fired the head of the FBI [James Comey]. He was crazy, a real nut job.
%
We show cases -- 99% of which are totally harmless -- results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have, Not in terms of the numbers, or in terms of the quality.
%
This is great news, but even better news is that death, and the death rate, is DOWN. Also, younger people, who get better much easier and faster!
%
Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities. Many of these people have no idea why they're doing this, but some know exactly what they are doing.
%
Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision [removal of Confederate Flags from NASCAR races] has caused lowest ratings EVER!
%
[Fred Trump Jr.] would have been an amazing peacemaker if he didn’t have the problem, because everybody loved him. He’s like the opposite of me.
%
That's a record, and that's the highest number ever.
%
I'm good at what I do.
%
We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World. The Fake News should be reporting these most important of facts, but they don’t! [Maybe beause it's not true...]
%
Wall is moving fast in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. Great numbers at the Southern Border.
%
Dems want people to just flow in. They want very dangerous open Borders!
%
Why does the Lamestream Fake News Media REFUSE to say that China Virus deaths are down 39%, and that we now have the lowest Fatality (Mortality) Rate in the World. [Because its not true?]
%
Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don’t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons, not for health reasons! They think it will help them in November. Wrong, the people get it!
%
SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!
%
BREAKING NEWS: The Mortality Rate for the China Virus in the U.S. is just about the LOWEST IN THE WORLD! Also, Deaths in the U.S. are way down, a tenfold decrease since the Pandemic height (and, our Economy is coming back strong!).
%
Why isn’t the Fake News reporting that Deaths are way down? It is only because they are, indeed, FAKE NEWS!
%
Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!
%
New China Virus Cases up (because of massive testing), deaths are down, “low and steady”.
%
China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the World!
%
If you want your 401k’s  and Stocks, which are getting close to an all time high (NASDAQ is already there), to disintegrate and disappear, vote for the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats and Corrupt Joe Biden. Massive Tax Hikes - They will make you very poor, FAST!
%
Mail-In Ballots will lead to MASSIVE electoral fraud and a RIGGED 2020 Election.

We cannot let it happen!
%
....The Fake News Media is being laughed at all over the world!
%
Well, I think we are in a good place. I disagree with [Dr. Anthony Fauci].
%
Dr. Fauci said don't wear masks and now he says wear them. And he said numerous things. Don't close off China. Don't ban China. I did it anyway. I didn't listen to my experts and I banned China. We would have been in much worse shape.
%
We've done a good job [on the Coronavirus outbreaks]. I think we are going to be in two, three, four weeks, by the time we next speak, I think we're going to be in very good shape.
%
I think you're going to see with all of the things that we're doing, and with all of the therapeutics that are coming out, and then ultimately the vaccine, we're going to be in very good shape very soon.
%
I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools.
%
In Germany, Denmark, Norway,  Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS.
%
THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER, JUST WATCH!!!
%
Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected. Job growth is biggest in history. China Virus Mortality Rate is among the LOWEST of any country.
%
Only the little people pay taxes.
%
POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!
%
We have a totally corrupt previous Administration, including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...and nothing happens to them.
%
No Republican Senate Judiciary response, NO “JUSTICE”, NO FBI, NO NOTHING. Major horror show REPORTS on Comey & McCabe, guilty as hell, nothing happens. Catch Obama & Biden cold, nothing. A 3 year, $45,000,000 Mueller HOAX, failed
%
the Democrats send everything to politically corrupt New York, which is falling apart with everyone leaving
%
We catch the other side SPYING on my campaign, the biggest political crime and scandal in U.S. history, and NOTHING HAPPENS. But despite this, I have done more than any President in history in first 3 1/2 years!
%
Courts in the past have given “broad deference”. BUT NOT ME!
%
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!
%
Obama and Biden spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...BUT NOTHING!
%
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
%
For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better.
%
Well, we have a long time to think about the school stuff. Because, you know. But we want to have the schools open. I would say that when we talk about the fall, that seems like a long time. It's a long time. [School starts in a month and a half from this point.]
%
You know what happened in New York. Everyone's leaving because it's turned out to be a hellhole.
%
Roger is a stone-cold loser. ... He always tries taking credit for things he never did.
%
Roger has a really rough reputation. They talk about dirty trickster and lots of other things. But I've known him for a long time and he's actually a quality guy.
%
I didn't listen to my experts and I banned China. We would have been in much worse shape. You wouldn't believe the number of deaths more we would have had if we didn't do the ban.
%
We're working on [releasing my taxes] now. I have big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time.
%
I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed and Harry Reid baited him and Mitt Romney didn't file until a month and a half before the election and it cost him bigly.
%
As far as my return, I want to file it except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.
%
I will absolutely give my return but I'm being audited now for two or three [years' worth] now so I can't.
%
I'm going to Walter Reed to see some of our great soldiers who have been injured. Badly injured. And also see some of our Covid workers, people who have such a great job.
%
Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education. Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated! [Let's talk about the fraudulent Trump University while we're at it...]
%
We are with Saudi Arabia. We're staying with Saudi Arabia.
%
I like the Saudis. They are very nice. We make a lot of money with them. They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump.
%
[Saudis] buy apartments from me. They spend 40 million, 50 million.
%
And by the way, just so everybody... I have no business whatsoever with Saudi Arabia. Couldn't care less.
%
Schools must be open in the Fall. If not open, why would the Federal Government give Funding? It won’t!!!
%
Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!! [They are actually the same thing.]
%
I think they -- you know, there is an expression, an old expression, was used badly in old time ago in politics. I think they brainwashed [Joe Biden]. They brainwashed him. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what he's doing.
%
[Joe Biden] hasn't taken any cognitive test, because he couldn't pass one.
%
I took [a cognitive test] at Walter Reed Medical Center in front of doctors. And they were very surprised. They said, that's an unbelievable thing. Rarely does anybody do what you just did.
%
They -- in most -- most cases, in almost -- I mean, literally, in most cases, they automatically cure. They automatically get better. [They don't.]
%
I'm OK with it, if [Joe Biden] wants to do that. He's got the largest mask I think I have ever seen. It covers up a big proportion of his face.
%
And it's -- a lot of it is, it's you spreading, not them spreading.
%
Now, I'm usually fairly isolated, as the President, so I'm fairly isolated.
%
Well, a ship ventilation system is very much -- they circularize. And they are very much under review, to be honest with you.
%
Well, first of all, President Obama and Joe Biden spied on my campaign. They knew everything that was going on.
%
I know how the White House works, I guess I can say now, better than anybody.
%
Roger Stone was treated very unfairly, unbelievably unfairly. [for lying to Congress and witness tampering. Unfair?]
%
I am always thinking. I am always thinking.
%
He knew everything. He was probably in charge of it or was in charge of it. Joe Biden, you know, I don't know if he knows where he is, but he was there. He knew everything.
%
The next president is going to be able to pick two or three or one or whatever, but a lot of justices.
%
You can't do more than what we have done.
%
We are not going to be Venezuela.
%
2016? HERE WE GO AGAIN!
%
I LOVE @GoyaFoods!
%
Jeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don’t want him back in Washington!
%
Corrupt Joe has done nothing good for Black people!
%
Take back the Pulitzers, which have become a JOKE!
%
[Christopher Steele] A sick lier who was paid by Crooked Hillary & the DNC!
%
I don’t want my wife shouting at somebody like that, I really don’t want that.
%
I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing.
%
The stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.
%
I view that a person who is flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.
%
You have to have the face of Vivian Leigh to be a 10 if you are flat-chested.
%
I've never been against masks but I do believe they have a time and a place.
%
[I'll wear a mask] if I'm with soldiers, people that -- you know, I don't want to spread anything.
%
Hopefully I'll look good in a mask.
%
We will have over 450 Miles built by the end of the year. Have established some of the best Border Numbers ever.
%
The Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders for anyone, including many criminals, to come in!
%
If I win I may never see my property. I may never see these places again. I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go golfing. Believe me. Believe me.
%
My exercise is playing.
%
The Silent Majority will reign!
%
With no ratings, media will go down along with our great USA!
%
A friend is one who has the same enemies as you have.
%
My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.
%
A lot of people don't realize that ... the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
%
Do you know that we have one of the lowest mortality rates anywhere? If you know, Biden and Obama stopped their testing. They just stopped it. I'm sure you know that. You probably don't want to report it. But they stopped testing right in the middle. They just went no more testing, and much, much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously, with with respect to this, is the worst thing that's happened since probably 1917.
%
Is this what you want for your President??? With no ratings, media will go down along with our great USA!
%
If I were to run [for president], I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific!
%
[With Covid19] we mobilized to a level nobody thought possible.
%
You're going to abolish the suburbs with this [Obama-era ruling].
%
You look at the Intercoastal in Florida, you look at the lakes, you see thousands of boats with Trump signs and American signs, you've got the Trump-Pence sign all over.
%
I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?
%
LAW AND ORDER will prevail!
%
Joe Biden and the Radical Left want to Abolish Police, Abolish ICE, Abolish Bail, Abolish Suburbs, Abolish the 2nd Amendment – and Abolish the American Way of Life. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
%
The Biden-Sanders unity plan takes a sledgehammer to charter schools, punishing students for their zip codes. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
%
Wow. The @nytimes is under siege. The real reason is that it has become Fake News. They never covered me correctly - they blew it. People are fleeing, a total mess!
%
Has anyone ever done so well? I doubt it!
%
Jeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don’t want him back in Washington!
%
These radical politicians want to defund and abolish the police.
%
Never in history have Police been treated so badly as they are in Democrat run cities - and these cities are a mess.
%
Corrupt Joe Biden wants to defund our police. He may use different words, but when you look at his pact with Crazy Bernie, and other things, that’s what he wants to do.
%
I am the ultimate member of The Book of the Month Club.
%
Next up is Mary Trump, a seldom seen niece who knows little about me, says untruthful things about my wonderful parents (who couldn’t stand her!) and me
%
[re: Death of John Lewis] Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family.
%
Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
%
They want to eliminate single family zoning, bringing -- who knows -- into your suburbs, so your communities will be unsafe and your housing values will go down.
%
It's so crazy what's happening. Here's a guy [Joe Biden] who doesn't talk. Nobody hears him.
%
He never said 'xenophobic' because I don't think he knows what the word means. But he said it was 'xenophobic.'
%
[If Joe Biden wins the election] Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless.
%
Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church.
%
Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church.
%
We have some areas where we're putting out the [Coronavirus] flames or the fires, and that's working out well.
%
Mike Pence made a call just yesterday and said, 'What do you need?' Not one governor needed anything. They don't need anything. They have all the medical equipment they can have. Thank you, US government.
%
Real protesters don't go to printing shops.
%
John Adams was the first parishioner. Was he the fifth or sixth? Whatever. You'll figure it out. First supporter. First parishioner. [Actually, second. James Madison was first.]
%
I brought it out five days after they started. They wouldn't use the National Guard. I brought the National Guard to -- I told them, I said, you got to get the National Guard. We got them in. [Actually, governor Tim Walz called them in before Trump even spoke of it.]
%
We signed a bill. If you play with our monuments or our statues, you go to jail for 10 years. It's amazing how it all stops so fast. [It was an executive order, and it didn't impose punishments that didn't already exist.]
%
People who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of 10 years in prison. [10 years is actuallly the *maximum* term.]
%
And whether it's the cams, you know, the dash cam and the body cam, which is a camera, basically, very sophisticated camera, and other things, we have a lot of that in the bill. And it passed. And it -- and it's going to -- a lot of things are happening right now. But I signed an executive order. [It was a funding bill that did not pass.]
%
I have wanted to take care of DACA recipients better than the Do Nothing Democrats, but for two years they refused to negotiate - They have abandoned DACA. [The Democrats haven't abandoned DACA, and Trump continually tries to end the program entirely.]
%
Well, you know, they say -- everybody says it -- and nobody even disputes it: In the history of our country, nobody has done more than I have in the first three-and-a-half years. [This claim alone is widely disputed.]
%
[The Democrats are] probably against wind, too. [It is Trump himself who is against wind power.]
%
And the person they beat up was a Democrat who happened to be gay. [Senator Tim Carpenter] was probably out there rooting them on or something, because Democrats think it's wonderful that they're destroying our country.
%
The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots, using the China virus as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls.
%
Canada was ripping off Wisconsin and Iowa and other farm states. You have no idea what they -- 287% tariff. They were charging on farm products, on -- they would call it 'dairy products' -- 287%. And I stopped it. I stopped it. [The tariffs are still in the new USMCA. Only whey and margerine tariffs were eliminated.]
%
Do you think [New York Times] will apologize to me & their subscribers AGAIN when I WIN?
%
How about the fact that we've become the number one energy [producer] in the world, through me? [US has been top energy producer since 2012]
%
Women, it was the best in 75 years, so I have to apologize. Can you believe that? We did the best in 75 years, and I apologize to women.
%
[Obama committed] Treason. Treason. It's treason.
%
I'm doing telephonic rallies, and we'll call them the Trump rallies, but we'll do it by telephone.
%
We've done a great job, gotten very little credit for it. They've given credit to other people, we've, who frankly had much less to do with it than we did.
%
Our testing program is the best in the world.
%
No, I want people to have a certain freedom, and I don't believe [people should be forced to wear masks], no.
%
I don't agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears.
%
As you know, masks cause problems too, with that being said, I'm a believer in masks. I think masks are good.
%
We won two world wars. Beautiful world wars. That were vicious and horrible.
%
I don’t care what the military says.
%
I just look at – I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff.
%
I've been right probably more than anybody else.
%
There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!
%
The Radical Left Democrats, who totally control Biden, will destroy our Country as we know it. Unimaginably bad things would happen to America.
%
["Wallace: But can you give a, can you give a direct answer you will accept the election?"] I have to see. Look, you -- I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no, and I didn't last time either.
%
I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.
%
This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country.
%
Strong Stock Market Numbers. You want to see them dive? Vote for the Radical Left with their BIG Tax Hikes!
%
You will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus, but by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well - and we have done things that few other countries could have done!
%
We may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat. It was 100 degrees, making things very interesting!
%
Together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security.
%
I’ve met [accused child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell] numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach. I just wish her well, frankly. I wish her well. Whatever it is, I don’t know the situation with Prince Andrew, I just don’t know. I’m not aware of that.
%
Just ask Prince Andrew. He’ll tell you about it.
%
[Brian Epstein's] island was an absolute cesspool, just ask Prince Andrew about it.
%
I proved I was all there because I aced [the cognitive test].
%
There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!
%
Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. [Yet he refuses to wear one except for a single photo op.]
%
The fact is that many countries are suffering very, very badly, and they've been suffering from this virus for a long time. We've done much better than most.
%
Space is going to be the future. Both in terms of defense and offense and so many other things. Already, from what I'm hearing and based on reports, we are now the leader in space.
%
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.
%
I’m finding more and more people are saying ‘wash your hands,' so wash your hands. [This is July. They've been saying this since March at the very least.]
%
The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It's like you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. So they say could you repeat that? So. I said, yeah. So it's person, woman, man, camera, TV. Okay, that's very good. If you get it in order, you get extra points.

I've known Jeff [Epstein] for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.

I do it because I have, like a good memory. Because I'm cognitively there!

[Debrah Birx] can take a scarf and do like 15 things with it.

[The coronavirus]  will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better. Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is. [Finally he acknowledges and admits what EVERYONE already knows...]
%
These same experts were saying, don't wear it, at one point. Now they're saying wear it. So let's go with them. What difference does it make?
%
It's going to come and go. It will. When you look at what happened in New York and what happened in New Jersey and other places. And now you're looking and it's gone. I hope it stays gone.
%
I have to protect the American people. That's what I've always done, that's what I always will do, that's what I'm about.
%
We have to be vigilant, we have to be careful. And we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important.
%
[The federal military policing agents] have to be invited in. At some point we'll have to do something much stronger than being invited in. We'll go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready.

The Democrats in the House are trying to undo my big win Travel Ban Bill, which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great Country.

Nothing like this has ever for our citizens, especially our Seniors. REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!

So Obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign, and got caught - Open and shut case!

Like me, Jim is not a believer in “Cancel Culture”.

We did great things, but it doesn’t matter to the Dems!

John Bolton is, with the exception of Hillary, by far the worst offender of them all!

Great, but did MAGA have anything to do with [Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity's] great ratings success?

Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter.

The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016.
%
[Regis Philbin] kept telling me to run for President.
%
I love babies. I hear that baby crying. I like it.
%
Donald Trump is a very nice person.
%
So, if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, kock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.

All right, get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court. Don't worry about it.
%
Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would.

You know what [Saddam Hussein] did well? He killed terrorists.

[Barack Obama] is the founder of ISIS. I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.

The only thing [Hillary Clinton's] got going is the woman's card.

[Hillary Clinton is] the devil. He made a deal with the devil.

I know words. I had the best words. But there is no better word than 'stupid.'

How stupid are the people of Iowa?

[Putin] even called me 'brilliant.' Isn't that nice?

[Kim Jong Un is] the boss. It's incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one.

And then we fell in love. [Kim Jong Un] wrote me beautiful letters.

Rigged Election, and EVERYONE knows it!
%
Where is JUSTICE?
%
We'll put out the flames. And we'll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it's -- it's going to be under control.

So disgusting to watch Twitter’s so-called “Trending”, where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one.

The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt in history. They even spied on my campaign!

It sort of is curious a man works for us with us very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of, and yet they’re highly thought of but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all.

Kim Jong Un, he gets it. He totally gets it.

It is AMAZING in watching @FoxNews how different they are from four years ago. Not even watchable. They totally forgot who got them where they are!

I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...
%
[Fauci has] got this high approval rating. So why don't I have a high approval rating?
%
There will be no more affordable housing forced in to the suburbs. It's been going on for years. I've seen conflict for years. It's been hell for suburbia. We rescinded the rule three days ago so enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy your life.
%
[Affordable housing] is having a devastating impact on these once thriving suburban areas.
%
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???

Nobody ever brings up China; they always bring Russia, Russia, Russia.

Russia used to be a thing called the Soviet Union. Because of Afghanistan they went bankrupt. They became Russia, just so you do understand. The last thing that Russia wants is to get too much involved with Afghanistan.

I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It's a good number. No, I look forward to that election.

[How do you think history will remember John Lewis?"] I don't know...I don't know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration.
%
[Do you find John Lewis impressive?] Ah, I can't say one way or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive. But, no... he didn't come to my inaugeration. He didn't come to my State of the Union speeches. And that's okay. That's his right. And again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have. He should have come. I think he made a big mistake.
%
[John Lewis] was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights. But there were many others also.
%
We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack.  I also want to provide the latest on tropical storm Isaias. [It wasn't an attack.]

We think very substantially based on the numbers we’re very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way.
%
The virus, back to that, we are continuing to monitor and monitor a particular hotspots across the South Southwest and the West.
%
...we’ve gotten to understand this horrible plague that’s been unleashed in our country by China.
%
The data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always strong.
%
One is too much, one death because it should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped very easily by China in Wuhan.
%
We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlying conditions, especially the elderly with the underlying, whether it’s heart or diabetes.

When you look at what’s happening with Miami and it’s going, the numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very significantly.
%
We have great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices, prescription drug prices vary massively. Some of these companies are involved in that. Some of them aren’t. We’re having a tremendous… You’ll see a tremendous drop in price. We’re using favored nations. We’re using the rebates. We’re using everything.
%
So long I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them the middlemen and they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people.
%
Can you believe that billion gloves? And we distribute that to the governors, different states. And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy. That I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They’re very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
%
I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind. Yes. [It wasn't an attack. It was an industrial explosion.]
%
But when you take [the Covid-19 death tolls from New York, New Jersey and Florida] out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in, I will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers. [Take all of them, remove a major portion of them, and the numbers are smaller. Good logic, Donald!]
%
Wall Street Journal said very good things that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in Homeland Security.

As far as the various things that I may or may not sign, I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made as you know, very well in the hill. We’ll see what happens. But I have the right, including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things.
%
I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world and it shouldn’t have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don’t know. When you lose so many thousands of people and ultimately... so many thousands of people and, you know, ultimately it’ll be millions of people around the world. It’s a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing.
%
There comes a point when you just, you want to focus your testing in a different way and we’ll be announcing stuff.
%
Nobody thought it would be possible to get a five- minute and a 15-minute result. That’s a very accurate result.
%
So we’re looking at that very strongly. And we’re looking at doing something that if we do it…
%
We’ve done an incredible job in testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing. They can’t believe we’re able to do it.
%
Florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee.

Obama's talking about all of this, with the Global Warming, and that, and a lot of it is a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money making industry, okay?

Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax!
%
A lot of it's a hoax.
%
The Post Office for many, many years has been, you know, run in a fashion that hasn't been great -- great workers and everything, but they have old equipment, very old equipment. And I don't think the Post Office is prepared for a thing like this. You have to ask the people at the Post Office, but how can the Post Office be expected to handle? [Meddling with the election by undermining mail-in voting to cast doubt and discourage people from voting.]
%
My view is the schools should open. This thing's [Covid-19] going away. It will go away like things go away.
%
They are dying. That's true. And you -- it is what it is.
%
The Democrats are cheating on the election. Because that's exactly what they're doing. If you look at what they're doing even with these negotiations. That's an influence, and an unfair influence, on an election.

John Bolton, one of the dumbest people I’ve met in government and sadly, I’ve met plenty, states often that I respected, and even trusted, Vladimir Putin of Russia more than those in our Intelligence Agencies.
%
This was an illegal act like no other. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason. And Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies of the United States government to do it.
%
As far as Kamala is concerned, she’s a big tax raiser. She’s a big slasher of funds for our military and she’s got a lot of difficult things that she’s going to have to explain. Plus, she was very, very nasty to, probably nastier than Pocahontas, very disrespectful to Joe Biden.
%
It's hard to pick somebody that's been that disrespectful. [Kamala Harris] said things during the Democrat primary debates that were horrible about Sleepy Joe.
%
First of all [Joe Biden] roped himself into a certain group of people [Women]. Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it’s fine. I don’t know.

[University football players] are young strong people, they won't have a big problem with the China virus

[Covid-19] has very little impact on young people, the immune system, and plus, [the football players are] in great health.
%
You can request absentee ballots right now. Absentee ballots are great.
%
We're stopping really some very important items that they want. They want to do things that are very unfair with mail-in ballots, and they want to make sure that they're covered because it just is going to create a rigged election, in my opinion.
%
[Kamala Harris is] not a person who's liked.
%
I'm doing our country a big favor by bringing it up, and you know, from a common sense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure basic beautiful intelligence -- you know [mail-in voting] can't work.
%
Because too much light gets through the windows ... let's rip down the Empire State Building
%
[Democrats] don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals.
%
Sort of a madwoman, I call her, because [Kamala Harris] was so angry.
%
You have a few people that want to be cute, and I think they're going to lose their elections and that's a problem for the Senate.
%
They want $3.5 billion for something that'll turn out to be fraudulent, that's election money basically. They want $3.5 billion for the mail in votes. Universal mail-in ballots. They want $25 billion, billion, for the post office. Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots.
%
Bill Barr has a chance to be the greatest of all time. But if he wants to be politically correct, he'll be just another guy.

The world will be laughing and taking full advantage of the United States if Joe Biden ever became President. Our Country would COLLAPSE!

It's amazing the way Sleepy Joe buys into the Radical Left
%
Very poor morning TV ratings for MSDNC’s Morning Joe, headed by a complete Psycho named Joe Scarborough and his ditzy airhead wife, Mika
%
(thank you President Trump!)
%
Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots...But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting...
%
They need that money in order to make the post office work.
%
I heard today that [Kamala Harris] doesn't meet the requirements. [except that she does... this is another Trump birther shams]
%
[Biden] refuses to take questions. He never takes questions. I take questions, he never takes questions. And you sort of wonder what's going on because they are not that difficult. Some can be nasty, but they are not that difficult.
%
Maybe we'll be able to show that as fact.
%
I'm not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage. I don't know, I can't tell you that. But I do know this: I just want an accurate vote.
%
We have to have an honest election, and if it's not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it.
%
I think that's probably one of the reasons [Kamala Harris] was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race — because she got her facts wrong. You know, she's very bad on facts, she's very weak on facts.
%
The Democrats know the 2020 Election will be a fraudulent mess. Will maybe never know who won!
%
I have done more for WOMEN than just about any President in HISTORY!
%
The Middle East is more reasonable [than the Democrats].
%
[Louis DeJoy is] a fantastic man. He wants to make the Post Office great again.
%
[Louis DeJoy is] a very good businessman. He's very successful. And I know he wants to make the Post Office at least somewhat lose a lot less money than -- they've lost so much money over the decade. Nobody has ever -- nothing loses money like the Post Office. And he wants to make it successful [by crippling it before the election.]
%
Some states use “drop boxes” for the collection of Universal Mail-In Ballots. So who is going to “collect” the Ballots, and what might be done to them prior to tabulation? A Rigged Election? So bad for our Country. Only Absentee Ballots acceptable!
%
...they spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years.
%
[Joe Biden] got a horrible rating in Gallup.
%
The problem is, big surge [of Covid-19] in New Zealand. It's terrible. [New Zealand had 0 cases for more than 100 days, and at this time had 9 new cases, compared to the US, which has more than 10,000 new cases every day, which Trump claims is clear success.]

If you want a vision of your life under Joe Biden, imagine the smoldering ruins of Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland and the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago coming to every city and town in America.

Democrats want a world without police, without prisons, and without virtually any sort of law enforcement.
%
BUT DIDN’T SHE CALL HIM A RACIST??? DIDN’T SHE SAY HE WAS INCOMPETENT???
%
McCain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy
%
Joe Biden is the puppet of a Radical Left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America’s borders and boundaries.
%
You know, we're all saying about suburban women. The fact is, they're going to really want to support me, because we're for law and order.
%
Something is going on [with Joe Biden]. And I assume we will be able to find out sooner, rather than later, I hope. But something is going on. It's very strange.
%
He wants to take away, they will take away without question your Second Amendment. That's like, without question.
%
And, you know, they are having a hard time in California, as you know, although he's treated me very nicely, therefore I'm going to treat him very nicely.
%
They are sending out 51 million ballots to people that didn't ask for them. [This is untrue, of course.]
%
This is going to be the greatest scam in history. This will be the most fraudulent election in history.
%
Many of [the voters] will have been dead. Many of them will get more than one. But it's going to be a really horrible thing. It's just a horrible, horrible thing.
%
It's a horrible thing. It's a fraudulent election. Everybody knows it.
%
You don't even have to know politics to know it -- 51 million ballots are going to indiscriminately sent out to people that didn't even ask for them, people that say, 'Hey, I just got a ballot. That's great. Let me vote.'
%
It's a terrible thing. They're trying to steal the election.
%
I mean, they gave -- they declared her a winner over a guy that is right now looking around saying, what happened? He thought he won. They declared her a winner. [...because she won, doofus.]
%
No, you're not going to have -- you can't have it -- it's impossible to have a fair election like this.
%
I think it's pretty boring when you do tapes. I'm going to go live and do mine live.
%
And then [Kamala Harris] had certain numbers wrong, certain very interesting numbers were way off. [They were interesting because she gave a *lower* number of deaths, since deaths had increased by 20,000 by the time she recorded the video. So yes, the number of deaths was HIGHER, indeed.]
%
We had the greatest economy in history of any country. [Untrue.]
%
And now we want to open up and the Democrats have to open up their states and cities and they have to open up the schools and let's play football.
%
We are doing well. We're doing well. We got hit by this China plague. But other than that. I mean, we were rocking. And now we're going to be rocking again very, very soon.

Steve [Bannon] pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.

Steve [Bannon] joined me after I won the primaries, but I loved working with him!

After the worst debate performance in the history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance. They treated him like a dog - and always will.
%
They are sending out 51,000,000 Ballots to people who haven’t even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don’t even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election.
%
So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes, which are a voter security disaster. Among other things, they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also, who controls them, are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!

There’s no enthusiasm for Joe Biden

Actually, I think I’m leading in the Polls!

Happy Sunday! We want GOD!

I've been given a lot of credit for what I did there. Took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice, "the Paris Climate Accord."
%
We all wish well to China but what China has unleashed on the world, it's hard to even fathom.
%
Joe Biden put AOC, a young woman, not talented in many ways, in charge of his energy plan.
%
But it's still -- we've done a great job, get no credit for it and I don't want the credit.
%
We have a very strong travel ban and we don't want people that are going to come in and blow up our cities.
%
I like merit.
%
That basically means no windows, no nothing. It's very hard to do. I tell people when they want to go into some of these buildings, how are your eyes because they won't be good in five years.
%
And I hope you don't mind cold office space in the winter and warm office space in the summer because your air conditioning is not the same as the good old days.
%
Nobody disobeys my orders.
%
I have the ultimate authority.

Throw the bums out!

Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate.

You know what I say? Protest this, your ass. I don’t talk about my ass.

Who's hiring the radical professees?

Thousands or more African Americans are victim... and victims.

Convalescent plosma. You saw that?
%
Testing kits and personal to nursing homes, we gave.

If the incompetent Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, doesn’t get control of his city and stop the Anarchists, Agitators, Rioters and Looters, causing great danger to innocent people, we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago!
%
No, I want Big Ten, and all other football, back - NOW.
%
Great Ratings & Reviews Last Night.
%
Sadly, that is a very slow reaction time for a President. Our beloved USA needs a much faster, smarter, and tougher response than that. Get out there today, Joe!
%
... an unstable niece, who was now rightfully shunned, scorned and mocked her entire life, and never even liked by her own very kind & caring grandfather!
%
The problem is nobody wants to hurt anybody anymore.
%
[After signing an autograph] Here, sell this on ebay. You'll get 10 grand... If I put your name down, it loses a lot of value.
%
I don't want to see a woman president get in to that position the way [Kamala Harris would] do it. She's not competent. They're all saying, 'We want Ivanka.' I don't blame you.
%
We could have had 2 million [deaths]. We did everything right.
%
There’s not too many presidents that have done a job like we’ve done.
%
We’re going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes.
%
But so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we'd have a very, very solid, we would continue what we're doing, we'd solidify what we've done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done.
%
The only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength!
%
[Who is pulling Bide's strings?] People you've never heard of. People who are in the dark shadows. People that are... they are people that are on the streets. They are people that are controlling the streets.
%
We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this week. And in the plane it was completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, dark uniforms with gear and this and that. I'll tell you sometime, but its under investigation right now.
%
Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!
%
We've done a great job in Covid but we don't get the credit.
%
Let them send [their vote] in, and let them go vote, and if the system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote.
%
Send in your ballots, send them in strong, whether it's solicited or unsolicited... the absentees are fine, we have to work to get 'em, you know, it means something... and you send 'em in but you go to vote, and if they haven't counted it, you can vote. So that's the way I view it.

The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29,000! You are so lucky to have me as your President. With Joe Hiden' it would crash.
%
[Being presidet is] probably costing me from $3 to $5 billion for the privilege of being — and I couldn't care less—I don't care. You know if you're wealthy, it doesn't matter.
%
From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for you.
%
I had a popularity rate ... I was close to 100% popular. [Trump's rating was never above 50%]
%
I never called John [McCain] a loser.
%
The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29,000! You are so lucky to have me as your President.
%
John McCain is a loser.
%
[John McCain] lost and let us down. I've never liked him as much after that. I don't like losers.
%
We're not going to support that loser's [John McCain's] funeral.
%
What the fuck are we doing that [lowering flags] for? Guy [John McCain] was a fucking loser.
%
Did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as [Joe Biden]? It gives him a feeling of security. If I was a psychiatrist, I'd say this guy has some big issues.
%
I've met so many police. I have the endorsement of like, so many, maybe everybody.

Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.

We're not negotiating with Canada right now.

Next year will be BEST EVER, unless a very Sleepy person becomes President and massively raises your taxes - In which case, CRASH!
%
What do you know? Let me tell you, I know my customers [supporters?], 'cos that's what I do.

[Democrats] don't want to make a deal because they know its good for the economy.

I've done very well with deals. That's what I do.

I'm taking the high road by not seeing them.

A friend of mine said you have to be the most innocent, honorable man to ever hold the office of president.

This is the most important election in American history!

.@CNN IS FAKE NEWS, and all smart people know that!
%
I still like playing it down [Covid], because I don't want to create a panic.
%
I've always said I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln, when he's wearing the hat.
%
You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed... It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus. [February 2020, dispite continually stating he didn't know and nobody warned him thereafter.]
%
I thought [Kamala Harris] was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the US Senate.
%
You know, I want to see the first woman president also, but I don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way [Kamala Harris would] do it -- and she's not competent. She's not competent. They're all saying, 'We want Ivanka.' I don't blame you.
%
You know what, people don't like [Kamala Harris]. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.
%
[Democrats] want to destroy your suburbs. You know that.
%
[Trump lied about the seriousness of Covid19 because] you cannot show a sense of panic or you're going to have bigger problems than you ever had before. The fact is I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don't want people to be frightened. I don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength.
%
I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.
%
They always call the other side 'the elite.' Why are they elite? I have a much better apartment than they do. I'm smarter than they are. I'm richer than they are. I became president and they didn't.
%
My whole life really has been a 'no' and I fought through it. It has not been easy for me, it has not been easy for me.
%
If Joe Biden is elected, far-left lunatics won’t just be running failed Dem Cities—they will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Supreme Court. No city, town or suburb will be safe.
%
Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!
%
I don't know if someone like that can write good.

They're starting again in California. I said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests -- there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up.
%
I have done a tremendous amount for the Black community. And honestly I'm not feeling the love.
%
I don't want to jump up and down and start screaming, 'Death! Death!'
%
Oh, look at my African-American over here. Look at him! Are you the greatest?
%
Not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner [on Coronavirus... obviously a lie.]
%
I am running for re-election... to ensure the future belongs to AMERICA—NOT China. If we win, AMERICA WINS! If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden Wins, the rioters, anarchists, and arsonists win.
%
How different my life would have been if this fraud on America was never committed!!!
%
These shutdowns are ridiculous, and only being done to hurt the economy prior to the most important election, perhaps, in our history!
%
If Joe Biden is elected, far-left lunatics won’t just be running failed Dem Cities—they will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Supreme Court. No city, town or suburb will be safe.
%
Biden Underperforming! ... What else is new, the story of his life.

You know [the number of forest fires on the west coast] is about forest management. Please remember the words — very simple — forest management. Please remember. It's about forest management. And other things, but forest management.
%
We're going to win four more years in the White House and then after that we'll negotiate, right? Because... based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.
%
[The climate will] start getting cooler. You just watch... I don't think science knows, actually.
%
I was in the White House a couple of days ago, meeting with 10 people in the Oval Office and a guy sneezed, innocently. Not a horrible... You know, just a sneeze, the entire room bailed out, OK? Including me, by the way.
%
I got rid of ISIS after [Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis] was gone. I did a great job on ISIS, 100% of the caliphate, got rid of 'em.
%
I would have rather taken [Syrian president Bashar al-Assad] out. I had him all set. [Jim] Mattis didn't want to do it.
%
Let's fucking kill [Syrian president Bashar al-Assad]! Let's go in. Let's kill the fucking lot of them!"
%
[Woodward's book Rage is] okay. I mean, it's fine.
%
Did you see where Joe Biden — as Weak, Tired, and Sleepy as he is, went to a Polling Place today in Delaware (of course!) to VOTE!?
%
Now we await the decision on the Rigged Ballot Scam, which is so bad for our Country!
%
[Trees] can explode!
%
All I want to do is get [Covid-19] solved. There are many people that said that to me. They said, you're now a wartime President.
%
Well I didn't downplay [the Covid-19 situation]. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action.
%
So that was called action, not with the mouth but in actual fact. We did a very very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important so we saved a lot of lives when we did that.
%
We are going to be okay. And it is (the virus) going to go away a lot faster even with or with the vaccine. You are going to develop a herd mentality.
%
A lot of people think masks are not good.
%
Democrats are “heartless”.
%
China is drooling. They can’t believe this!
%
I'm number one on Twitter.
%
I have to say this, whatever you can do in terms of November 3rd is going to be very important because if we don't win, Israel is in big trouble.
%
As far as the masks are concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks.
%
This is actually a new [Covid-19] test. It just came out from Abbot. Highly sophisticated, you wouldn't think. It's a piece of really little light cardboard.
%
There are a lot of people who think that masks are not good. And there are a lot of people that, as an example, I'll tell you who those people are -- waiters.
%
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
%
Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
%
If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg, after making a total fool of himself as he got badly beaten up by Pocahontas and the Democrats in the Primaries, is at it again.
%
So funny to watch the Fake News fawning over Sleepy Joe’s ridiculous “car press conference”. Pathetic!
%
If I lose, you'll never hear from me again.
%
Donald Prump... yea, Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump.
%
[Winston Churchill] was really brave, though he may have been drinking a little bit.
%
When you test, then you have... does this make sense? Then you have cases.
%
I'm being not honored, you are being honored, with the Nobel Peace Prize.
%
[The media is] a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but honestly, they are the enemy of the people.
%
They give [Biden] a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he's better than ever before ... we are going to ask for a drug test. Both of us.
%
I said [about Elizabeth Warren] look, this is not an Indian.
%
Good memory? Trump has a good memory.
%
We are taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things. Bad things, actually. We will teach our children the truth about America: That we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the Earth & we are getting better every single day.
%
We had a great State of the Union, right? Dwiga there. Good. You're looking well.
%
United States will be the first station to land an astronaut on Nars or Mars.
%
You say "How's President Drooin... Trump doing?"
%
I am the only thing standing between you and your 2nd Amendment. If I am re-elected, it is 100% SAFE. If not, it is GONE!
%
[Virginians] have a crazy Governor who wants to take away your guns, which he will do without me in office. He is in favor of executing babies after birth - this isn’t late-term abortion, this is a step way beyond!
%
[Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish] sounds so beautiful. But that sounds like a Schumer deal or maybe a Pelosi or shifty Schiff. So that came out of the wind. Let's see. I mean, maybe she did and maybe she didn't.
%
We should act quickly [replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat] because we're gonna have probably election things involved here. You know, because of the fake ballots they'll be sending out.
%
[The person to replace Ruth Bader Binsburg] will be a woman. I think it should be a woman because I actually like women much more than men.
%
[Violent protesters] go out and buy tuna fish and soup. You know that, right? They go out and buy Goya because they throw it. It's the perfect weight, tuna fish. They can really rip it, right? And then it hits you. No, it's true. Bumble Bee brand tuna.
%
[About Covid-19] We didn't know it. Now we know it. It affects elderly people, elderly people with heart problems and other problems. They have other problems, and that's what it really affects. That's it.
%
[Covid-19] affects virtually nobody. It's an amazing thing.
%
We have the, ah, I like to call it the super-duper missiles, like at a level nobody's ever seen... It's uh, hydrosonic. I call it super-duper, 'cos super-duper is easier for people to understand than hydrosonic. [Hydrosonic is a toothbrush technology...]
%
They don't like me. They don't like my personality. But I hate to say it, I'm what you need.
%
Is [Joe Biden] going to walk in [to the debates] with a mask?
%
If I listened to John Bolton, we'd be in World War 5 right now.
%
[Mattis] was fired. Like a dog, he was fired.
%
Same answer. Same answer. Same answer. Same answer...
%
[Hilary Clinton is] a terrific person, works hard, and I think she does a good job.
%
NASA was an absolute disaster. You know, Grass was growing through the fairways. They had fairways too. That's about all they used was the fairway. And now we have something right through the *runways*.
%
You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are. What they do, they use knives because it's more painful. They cut people up.
%
[Law enforcement] were grabbing [people] left and right. Sometimes they'll grab that one guy. "I'm a reporter!" [mimics tossing the person] "Get outta here!" They threw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn. But no, I mean honestly, when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long, when you see that it's actually you don't want to do that. But when you see it, it's actually a beautiful sight.
%
You know, we can joke. We can play games. We can have fun. You can't have this guy [Joe Biden] as your president. You can't have him. Maybe I'll sign an executive order: You cannot have him as your president.
%
You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very... there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation.
%
He feels good about the mask, and that's okay. You know what? Whatever makes you feel good. He feels good. He feels good. I mean, honestly, what the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic surgery if he's gonna cover it up with a mask?
%
Just as a person, I understand things.
%
This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation. Should be very easy... It's going to be very quick. I'm sure it'll be extremely non-controversial.
%
I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to, or after, the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally, I will agree to take one also. His Debate performances have been record setting UNEVEN, to put it mildly. Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy???
%
WATCH THE BALLOTS!!!
%
A three year HOAX. A failed COUP!
%
A great Scam against our Country!
%
@BarackObama who wants to raise all our taxes, only pays 20.5% on $790K salaray. 1.usa.gov/HFZJKH Do as I say not as I do.
%
I pay a lot of tax. I just signed a big fat check recently for a lot of tax. I paid literally, I paid a lot of tax and you know, look, I don't mind. I'm proud to pay it up. If I owe it, I pay it.
%
The amazing thing is that half of the country is paying nothing [in taxes]. Zero. And even if you don't make a lot, you should have to pay something. Just something to be a part of the game. Half of the country's paying nothing.
%
The idea that the lower class is shouldering the tax burden is absurd, because the bottom half of Americans pay no federal income tax at all.
%
I don't need a thank-you note from anyone. I make lots of money and pay lots of taxes.
%
I pay a lot, and I pay a lot in state income taxes.
%
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. As soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great.
%
Did you use the word "smart?" Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word.

Such a timid group of reporters at the Biden Press Conference. Where do these people come from?
%
Many more people would have died from the China Virus if Sleepy Joe were your President.
%
I guess I'm debating [Chris Wallace], not [Joe Biden], but that's OK. I'm not surprised.
%
I don't want to pay tax... I was a private developer. I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. [about not paying taxes]

I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad.

It's very hard not to hug all the big beautiful troops.
%
The First Lady and I are waiting for our [Covid] test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!
%
Whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don't know.
%
Tonight, @FLOTUS ad I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!
%
It's a tough kind of a situation. It's a terrible thing. So I just went for a [Covid] test, and we will see what happens. I mean, who knows?
%
You have to treat our people great. You can't say 'Stay away, stay away.' They come up to you, they have such love with what we've done for them. There's such love. You have to treat our people great.
%
[Hope Hicks] is a very warm person, she has a hard time — when soldiers and law enforcement come up to her, you know, she wants to treat them great, not say 'Stay away, I can't get near you.' It's a very, very tough disease.
%
I just want to say that the end of the pandemic is in sight.
%
I don't wear masks like [Joe Biden]. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from them and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.
%
I was given that alternative -- stay in the White House, lock yourself in, don't ever leave. Don't even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don't see people, don't talk to people and just be done with it. And I can't do that. I had to be out front and this is America, this is the United States. [It is reported that Trump actually didn't want to go to the hospital because it would make him look weak. So of course he spun it to sound more "honourable"]
%
If you want to know the truth, they are miracles. People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from God.
%
I learned a lot about COVID.
%
I can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe, and just say, hey whatever happens, happens. I can't do that.
%
Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!
%
I learned [about Covid] by really going to school. This [hospitalization] is the real school. This isn't the "let's read the book" school and I get it, and I understand it. And it's a very interesting thing. And I'm going to be letting you know about it.
%
We have enthusiasm like probably nobody's ever had... We have more enthusiasm than maybe anybody. [Said from the hospital while suffering from Covid]
%
Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!
%
Don't be afraid of [Covid-19]. You're going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines.
%
Maybe I'm immune [from Covid-19]
%
One thing's for certain. Don't let it dominate you. Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it.
%
Don't let [Coronavirus] dominate. Don't let it take over your lives. Don't let that happen. We're the greatest country in the world. We're going back. We're going back to work. We're going to be out front, and I know there's a risk. There's a danger, but that's okay. And now I'm better. And maybe I'm immune! I don't know!
%
I know there's a risk. There's a danger, but that's okay. And now I'm better [from Covid]. And maybe I'm immune!

%
I don't think I'm contagious, at all [2 days after release from the hospital.]
%
I think I'm better... to a point where I'd love to do a rally tonight. I wanted to do one last night. I feel perfect. There's nothing wrong [2 days after being released from the hospital with Covid-19].
%
No matter how good the security, you're not going to protect yourself from this thing... You catch this thing. It's particles of dust.
%
I'll be tested very soon, but I'm essentially very clean. They say it's over a period of six, seven days.
%
it's a tiny, tiny it's like a tiny little microscopic piece of dust. It gets into nose your mouth or your eye, frankly, or something else or you touch something. So, I understand, and then you get better.
%
[Kamala Harris]  was terrible. I don’t think you can get worse. And totally unlikeable. And she is. She’s a communist. She’s left of Bernie. She’s rated left of Bernie by everybody. She’s a communist.

This monster [Kamala Harris] that was onstage with Mike Pence, who destroyed her last night, by the way. This monster, she says, ‘No no, there won’t be fracking,’ there won’t be this. Everything she said is a lie.

I'm back because I'm a perfect physical specimen, and I'm extremely young, and so I am lucky in that way.

COVID-19. I said what’s the 19, COVID-19, some people can’t explain what the 19, give me… COVID-19, I said, “That’s an odd name.”
%
Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word.
%
They’re very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude.
%
I could give you a list. I could grade them. I could grade them out from one to 50, and you’d be amazed. You might be surprised at some of them.
%
I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is.
%
I don’t have any of the problems you hear about. Perhaps a couple pounds here and there.
%
I think I'm going to try doing a rally on Saturday night. If we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally in Florida probably on Saturday night. Might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. [While still convelescing from Covid-19]
%
We have, I call them cures. I don't call them therapeutics. You take it, it's an antibody drug. You take it, and it beats the hell out of it. And I'm telling you I could have walked out 24 hours after I... I didn't have to go in, frankly. I think it would have gone away. And what I'm doing, is I am going to supply this drug - it made me better, I will tell you right now - I walked in, I didn't feel great. I think I would have done it fine without the drugs, you know. You don't really need drugs. I stopped. I don't take them anymore. No, I don't take them anymore. I think taking almost nothing.
%
I think you're going to see a very big explosion of voting.
%
She said she had 33,000 e-mails. They're in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo is unable to get them out, which is very sad actually. I'm -- I'm not happy about him for that, that reason. He was unable to get -- I don't know why. You're running the State Department and you get them out. But they're in the State Department.
%
I was in that hospital, I was watching down over so many people...
%
I took a little heat for [for the SUV joyride at the hospital], but I'd do it again, let me tell you. I'd do it again.
%
We are starting very, very big with our rallies and with our everything.
%
[The Regeneron treatment candidate is] a great medicine. I mean I feel better now than I did two weeks ago. It's crazy. And I recovered immediately, almost immediately. I might not have recovered at all from Covid.
%
If [Obamacare] is terminated by the Supreme Court, would be a big WIN for the USA!
%
You're going to get better fast, just like I did. Good luck.
%
I killed Soleimani, I killed al-Baghdadi – names that everybody, bigger names than Osama bin Laden. Nobody could find them until I came along.
%
We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare, at a FAR LOWER COST - BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW. HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED. YOU’RE WELCOME!
%
The Economy is about ready to go through the roof. Stock Market ready to break ALL-TIME RECORD. 401k’s incredible. New Jobs Record. Remember all of this when you VOTE. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your Taxes. Depression!!! Don’t let it happen!
%
Illinois has no place to go. Sad, isn't it?
%
New York has gone to hell.
%
California is going to hell.
%
Remember, I wouldn’t be President now had Obama and Biden properly done their job. The fact is, they were TERRIBLE!!!
%
Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, like perhaps never seen before.
%
A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!
%
To me [the cocktail of therapueutics used at Walter Reed Hospital] wasn't therapeutic. It just made me better, OK? I call that a cure.
%
I'm not gonna say the best, but I'm just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico.
%
I feel so powerful, I'll walk into that audience. I'll walk in there, I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the -- everybody. I'll just give everybody a big, fat kiss.
%
Pete Buttigieg - he's the failed mayor of a failed town.
%
I don't want to build low-incoming housing next to your houses. And that's okay. 
%
And then I hear that the suburban woman - I think that this suburban woman and I used to say a suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, does anybody care? Do you care? My sister will go, No.
%
They say "Trump said suburban housewife," but I didn't because I don't.
%
Suburban woman, they should like me mor than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood! I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs. And you're going to live the American Dream! And that's what you're gonna do.
%
Suburban women, would you please like me?
%
We have made America wealthy again.
%
I don't want to pay taxes!
%
When you look at the amount of money [I probably owe], $400 million is a peanut, it is extremely underlevered. It is levered with normal banks, not a big deal. [Whatever levered/underlevered means, that's what his $400,000,000 debt is...]
%
You have my friend and he's a nice guy Tony, Tony Fauci. He's a nice guy. He said, 'This is not a threat. This is not a problem. Don't worry about this, it's not a problem.' That's the craziest thing. Then he said, 'Do not wear a mask. Do not wear a mask under any circumstance. Don't wear a mask -- don't, don't, don't,' right? So, we don't wear a mask, then they say 'Oh, wear a mask.' I never saw -- do you ever see any conflicts? But he's a nice guy so I keep him around, right? We'll keep him around.
%
The black community gets it. They don’t dig [Joe Biden], they don’t like him.
%
I don't call it Twitter. I call it Social Media.
%
[If I lose to Biden] maybe I'll have to leave the country. I don't know.
%
I have real estate. You know a lot of it, OK, right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff.
%
Did you ever hear the expression, under levered? I am extremely under levered. [it's "under leveraged"]
%
[About why he won't release his taxes] No person in their right mind would release prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I'll go a step further. I'm treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly.
%
I think it's a filing number. You pay $750, it's a filing -- or a filing fee. [That suggests he paid $0 in those years for taxes as well!]
%
I don't owe money to any of these sinister people.
%
When you look at vast properties like I have and they're big and they're beautiful and they're well located, when you look at that the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It's extremely under levered. And it's levered with normal banks, not a big deal.
%
[Does he owe money to a foreign bank or entity?] Not that I know of but I will probably because it's so easy to solve and if you'd like to do -- I will let you know who -- who I owe whatever small amount of money.
%
Dammit, Minnesota, you better vote for me. [He was in Michigan.]
%
We are Americans and we will prevail. We are prevailing. We are.
%
The Biden family is a criminal enterprise. Frankly it makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like an amateur.
%
I heard they like my policies, but they don't like my personality. They don't care about my personality. They want to be safe, and they want to keep their American dream.
%
I could raise more money, I'd be the world's greatest fundraiser, but I just don't want to do it.
%
When he was fired, [Steve Bannon] not only lost his job, he lost his mind.
%
Not my Wall, which will soon be finished (and Mexico will pay for the Wall!). Totally unrelated, but I think Steve [Bannon] will be just fine.
%
I saved your suburbs -- women -- suburban women, you're supposed to love Trump.
%
Go buy a dishwasher... I said what's wrong with this thing? It doesn't clean the dishes right. The women come up to me — they women who they say don't like me -- they actually do like me a lot.
%
Suburban women, please vote for me. I'm saving your house.
%
I don't know, there's something about that — when you watch everybody getting pushed around — there's something very beautiful about it. I don't care what I'm doing. Not politically correct ... But you people get it.
%
That was an opinion of somebody, and that was a retweet. I'll put it out there. People can decide for themselves [about whether the US actually killed a Bin Laden body double. Trump promoting a crazy conspiracy theory...]
%
I don't want to hurt [Dr. Anthony Fauci]. He's been there [with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] for about 350 years.
%
People are tired of Covid. I have these huge rallies. People are saying whatever. Just leave us alone. They're tired of it. People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.
%
Fauci is a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years.
%
Fauci is a disaster. If I listened to him, we'd have 500,000 deaths.
%
Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb, but there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. This guy’s a disaster.
%
We let [Dr. Anthony Fauci] do what he wants to do. He gets a lot of television, he loves being on television.
%
We're going to win. I wouldn't have told you that maybe two or three weeks ago. [Except that he has always been saying this, repeatedly.]
%
Did you see they found 50,000 ballots in like a river? [This is a like Trump seems to really enjoy repeating. Now it's 50,000!]
%
You have plenty of them in Los Angeles, you know, they had many people, they were over a hundred years old. Every one of 'em voted for years. Then they got to be 110, they kept voting and then people said, 'Well this is getting to be like record territory, you know.' When you have hundreds of them voting, nah, it's a lot of corrupt stuff going on... [This story is actually made up.]
%
The Democrat party you once knew, just no longer it exists, right? This is not the same party. These people are crazy.
%
Do you remember 12 years ago or so I got Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, “Well, that’s nice.” [Trying to rewrite history in Michigan.]
%
One of the most sinister weapons of the extreme left culture is a thing called cancel or cancel culture. They want to cancel our entire heritage.
%
Look at that. Is that beautiful? That’s a beautiful plane. We have a beautiful country. Actually, I have the exact same plane, Boeing 757. It’s a beautiful plane. Look at that though.
%
We became a lot different country for a period of time because we had this horrible plague that came from China. And we’re not going to forget that it came from China and all over the world it went, and it came from China. Okay? It came from China, the China virus.
%
You know, they’re sitting there and standing there and they had various things that they were holding. I won’t get into that because they’ll say, “That’s terrible. He’s inciting violence.” The President.
%
They coulda called about two weeks earlier, right? [He brought in the Guard 2 days after the protests began. 2 weeks earlier was more than a week before George Floyd was killed.]
%
Mexico is paying for the wall. [They haven't, and probably never will.]
%
I always say 'Democrat.' Do you know why? Because it sounds worse. They should actually change the name to the Democratic -- 'Democrat' sounds lousy, but you know what, that's actually their name, the Democrat Party, right? The Democrat Party. So I always say Democrat. They say 'Democratic.' I say, why don't you try changing your name officially? [It actually *is* the Democratic Party. It's very strange that Trump doesn't know this.]
%
People are tired of Covid. I have the biggest rallies I've ever had, and we have Covid.
%
They're always complaining, 'I don't see masks.' I mean there are a lot of masks on. [More wordsmithing, because the problem is the number of masks OFF, of which that includes the majority of people at the rallies.]
%
Can I be honest? He may be right [about conspiracy theories]. I just don't know about QAnon.
%
The only thing I say is he’s a little bit sometimes not a team player.
%
I’m not running scared. I’m running angry. I’m running happy, and I’m running very content ’cause I’ve done a great job.
%
"It affects elderly people"

"It affects virtually nobody"
%
I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME!
%
[Trump rape accuser E. Jean Carroll is] not my type.
%
Washington wants nothing to do with [Gov. Cuomo], and that’s so bad for New York, which has become a ghost town.
%
I'm not running scared. I'm running angry because... I think I'm running angry [accordion hands], I'm running happy, and I'm running very content.
%
People are pandemicked out. You know that?
%
Make America Great again, again again, again again.
%
If I cry, then you won't love me anymore.
%
I woke up and I felt great. I said "Get me out of here!" BOOM! Superman!
%
There's no way I'm going to wear a hat. Gotta show strength!
%
My doctors have given more information than has been given on any human being in the history of the world.
%
You are a criminal for not reporting [on Hunter Biden's supposed laptop.]
%
Before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie. I mean, I have to be honest. There's no way I was coming.
%
They said "Would you like to wear a hat?" and I said "There's no way I'm wearing a hat."
%
Women. I like women!
%
I could blow away your [fundraising] records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money.
%
We beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of [the money she raised.]
%
[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has] got a good line of stuff. [Nobody seems able to figure out what this means...]
%
I do love the environment.
%
So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.
%
Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability.
%
[Is DJT concerned the virus could reach the Whitehouse?] I'm not concerned at all.
%
It's going to come. It's going to be bad. And maybe it will be worse than the normal flu seasons. And it's going to go away. I think it is being handled fine. I think the words are right. [Trump on Obama and Biden's handling of H1N1.]
%
I was on her show for the last week. In other words, the entire show was devoted to -- I think five different people. I was one of the five. Oprah liked me. And maybe still does, I don't know. But Oprah is great. [Trump wasn't on the final week. He was on 3 1/2 months prior to the last episode.]
%
I think they're trying to burn the tape. Are they trying to burn the tape? [Trump's excuse for nobody seeing him on the final week of Oprah. It was actually because he wasn't there. Period. There were a lot more than 5 A-listers on the final week, and Trump was not one of them.]
%
Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream!
%
VOTE FOR TRUMP. Our City and State are a MESS. What do you have to lose?
%
This is not going to end well.
%
I don't think I'd be here if I didn't have social media.
%
If we didn't do testing, cases would be way down.
%
That's right, we have turned the corner [on Covid-19 infections]. [Nowhere near true...]
%
Where did I call [Fauci] an idiot? [Reminder: People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.]
%
When did I say lock her up? When did I say lock up the governor? I never said lock up the governor.
%
Lesley, that's such a vicious thing you just said. I didn't say lock up the governor of Michigan. I would never say that. Why would I say that?
%
You have seen [my health plan]. I've been putting out pieces all over the place. [Where?]
%
Today I walk in, I hear I'm going to fire him. I'm not firing him. I think he is a wonderful guy.
%
You know why there are so many cases? Because we test. Because we test more than any country in the world, nobody tests like us.
%
Everybody uses the word 'cases'... Use the word 'case' because you're trying to scare people. Don't scare people. Don't scare people. The fact is, that we're doing very well.
%
I'll remember it, Tom. I'm gonna remember it, Tom. 'Hello, Mr. President, this is Governor Wolf, I need help, I need help.' You know what? These people are bad. [Trump threatening a governor for making him comply with their Covid-19 protocols for his rally.]
%
Take a look. Yesterday we were in Arizona, record-setting rallies. Numbers of people like nobody's seen before. ["You used to have bigger rallies."] No, these are much bigger than I ever had-- You know, you're-- you're-- --so negative. You're so negative. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had. You just come in here with that negative attitude. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.
%
Your [Michigan] governor, I don't thinks she likes me too much.
%
After the election, we'll get the best stimulus package you've ever seen, because I think we're going to take back the House because of [Nancy Pelosi].
%
I think we are going to win the House. We'll see. But I think we are going to win the House.
%
Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump? I'm like a Ph.D. in litigation.
%
I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me. I've made a fortune by using debt, and if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing.
%
When somebody’s president of the United States, the authority is total.
%
Why isn’t Twitter trending Biden corruption? It’s the biggest, and most credible, story anywhere in the world. Fake Trending!!!
%
When I come home and dinner's not ready, I'll go through the roof, okay?
%
[referring to a 3-year old girl] I'm going to be dating her in 10 years.
%
What a stupid question!
%
Even these spoiled rich Jewish guys. They can't believe how good this is, you know?
%
Fake Trending!!!
%
Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, & many tests of young people.
%
[Joe Biden] wants to send YOUR jobs to China, while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party.
%
If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m NOT a politician.
%
I don't sound like a politician because I'm not a politician. I never wanted to be a politician.
%
[I'm] getting your husbands -- they want to get back to work. We're getting your husbands back to work.
%
[With Biden] you would see problems like you have never seen.
%
We will vanquish the virus and emerge stronger than ever before. Our country will be stronger than ever before.
%
There are a couple senators I can't really get involved in. I just can't do it. You lose your soul if you do. I can't help some of them. I don't want to help some of them.
%
Everything is Covid, Covid, Covid. I had it, and here I am, right?
%
See those men? I'll kiss those men. I'm not into that, but I will kiss every man there and kiss every woman there if you don't mind girls. They won't catch anything!
%
And in California you have this special mask. You cannot under any circumstances take it off. You have to eat through the mask. It's a ... Right Charlie? It's a very complex mechanism. And they don't realize it, those germs to through it like nothing.
%
People are breaking into stores and walking out with washing machines, and walking out with all sorts of things, and it shouldn't be allowed.
%
If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, and no Fourth of July together, and other than that, you have a wonderful life.
%
Get the hell out and vote, because if I don't get Iowa, I won't believe that one! I may never have to come back here again if I don't get Iowa, I won't ever be back here again!
%
You know, it's windy as hell out here!
%
Is that Sun hot, or what?
%
What the hell do you think I'm doing here on a freezing night with 45 degree wind?
%
It's freezing and it's raining!
%
Nobody told me there are 40 miles an hour wind today. Can somebody give me a...
%
I'm outa here. What the hell's time is it? And it's freezing.
%
We're all freezing our asses off...
%
I'm sitting in the hottest Sun I've ever felt.
%
Nice trucks. Do you think I could hop into one of them and drive away? I'd love to do it. Just drive the hell out of here...
%
You're gonna get better. You're gonna get better. If I can get better, anybody can get better. And I got better fast.
%
Now, how about California where you're supposed to eat with a mask -- can't take it off -- You see people, and boy, when you have spaghetti and meat sauce, that mask is not looking. You walk out and it looks like you got into a fight with Dana White.
%
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years - selling out to lobbyists, China, big pharma & foreign countries. He will stab you in the back.
%
[Joe Biden] only cares about political power & he will use that power to hurt you & enrich his cronies!
%
Our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, 'I'm sorry but everybody dies of Covid.'
%
Biden's plan to Abolish American Energy is an economic DEATH SENTENCE for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to BAN FRACKING & send PA into a nightmare of poverty & depression.
%
But one thing I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.
%
Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state.
%
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who SOLD OUT Pennsylvania to CHINA!
%
Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt your are supporting Joe Biden
%
Joe Biden is not primetime.
%
We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!
%
I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN!
%
WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU! [Tweeted while Trump was behind in both the popular vote and the college vote.]
%
Get out & VOTE! Under my Administration, our ECONOMY is growing at the fastest rate EVER at 33.1%. Next year will be the GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR in American History!
%
Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight, and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people. And we won't stand for it.
%
We were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything, and all of a sudden it was just called off.
%
Florida, we didn't win it... we won it by a lot. [51.2% to 47.8% is a razer-thin "lot"]
%
We won Texas by 700,000 votes and they don't even include it in the tabulations.
%
It's also clear that we've won Georgia. [While there is a 2000 vote difference and still not finished counting.]
%
We're not just coming into what we call Trump Territory. I don't know what you call it, but these were friendly Trump voters. And that could be overturned.
%
We're winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount. [Whle there is a 5000 vote difference and still not finished counting.]
%
I said Michigan, wow that'a a lot. [While there is a 2000 vote difference and still not finished counting.]
%
You know what happened? They knew they couldn't win so they said, "Let's go to court." And did I predict this?
%
We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly we did win this election.
%
So our goal right now, and this is a very big moment, This is a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the US SUpreme court. We want all the voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 in the morning and add them to the list.
%
We will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have won it.
%
Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the “pollsters” got it completely & historically wrong!
%
How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?
%
They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
%
STOP THE FRAUD!
%
All of the recent Biden claimed States will be legally challenged by us for Voter Fraud and State Election Fraud. Plenty of proof - just check out the Media. WE WILL WIN! America First!
%
Big legal win in Pennsylvania!
%
.....there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported!
%
It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate.
%
I consider firing everybody. At some point, that's what happens.
%
If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.
%
We were winning in all of the key locations by a lot, actually, and our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away... They want to find out how many votes they need and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait and then they find them.
%
In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name Biden on them, or just about all, I think almost all. They all had the name Biden on them, which is a little strange.
%
It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided.
%
Detroit and Philadelphia, known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily, cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race, a very important presidential race.
%
The pollsters got it knowingly wrong,
%
I will totally accept the results of this great, and historic presidential election, IF I WIN!
%
A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!
%
I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!
%
Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true!
%
If Biden somehow manages to win this election, you won't see me again, I'll simply leave the country!
%
What a total mess this “election” has been!
%
Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states.
%
Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed.
%
BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE!
%
I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST.
%
STOP THE COUNT!
%
We are winning Pennsylvania big, but the PA Secretary of State just announced that there are “Millions of ballots left to be counted.”
%
They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear — ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!
%
We love winners. Winners are winners.
%
No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.
%
71,000,000 Legal Votes. The most EVER for a sitting President!
%
BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
%
I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!
%
What a total mess this “election” has been!
%
Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed.
%
I know fellow Americans that are evil ... I've known some fellow Americans that are pretty evil.
%
I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.
%
If [Biden] is elected, the stock market will crash. [On the contrary, it went up consecutively for days.]
%
Pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the Ballot count. Unthinkable and illegal in this country.
%
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
%
I'm not a good loser.
%
With the attack by the Radical Left Dems on the Republican Senate, the Presidency becomes even more important!
%
This is good news, it means I won!

BALLOT COUNTING ABUSE!

WATCH FOR MASSIVE BALLOT COUNTING ABUSE AND, JUST LIKE THE EARLY VACCINE, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU SO!
%
The @US_FDA and the Democrats didn’t want to have me get a Vaccine WIN, prior to the election, so instead it came out five days later – As I’ve said all along!
%
People will not accept this Rigged Election!
%
Very sad to watch [Fox News ratings fall], but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose.
%
This Election was Rigged, from Dominion all the way up & down!
%
For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been. Now they are saying what a wonderful job the Trump Administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. Actually this is true, except for what the Democrats did. Rigged Election!
%
Biden did not win, he lost by a lot!
%
As soon as April the vaccine will be available to the entire general population with the exception of places like New York State, where, for political reasons, the governor decided to say, and I don’t think it’s good from a political standpoint, but he wants to take his time with the vaccine.
%
I LOVE NEW YORK!
%
EXPOSE THE CRIME!
%
When will this RIGGED ELECTION be overturned!
%
These states in question should immediately be put in the Trump Win column. Biden did not win, he lost by a lot!
%
He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
%
RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
%
[Biden] won because the Election was Rigged.
%
All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught.
%
Doing a great job in Georgia. Their recount is a scam, means nothing.
%
SUPPRESSION!
%
Stop playing politics!
%
EXPOSE THE CRIME!
%
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and restore PATRIOTIC EDUCATION to our schools!
%
It wasn’t [Americans'] fault that the Plague came in from China!

I won the Election!

John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

And by the way, who knew the other side of the picture better than me?

...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

“DEAD PEOPLE VOTED”

You're fired. Bing, get out.
%
VACCINES ARE COMING FAST!!!
%
We withdrew because we won!
%
This RINO will never make the grade. Hogan is just as bad as the flawed tests he paid big money for!
%
We have great support on the Election Hoax!
%
The great @FoxNews daytime ratings CRASH will only get worse!
%
I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols [for giving Biden access prior to his inaugeration], and have told my team to do the same.
%
Great, but we also won the election! [Of course... he didn't]
%
AMERICA FIRST!!!
%
Will never concede to fake ballots & “Dominion”.
%
Don't talk to me that way. You’re just a lightweight. I’m the president of the United States! Don't ever talk to the president that way. [He didn't feel that way with Obama. Let's see if he feels that way with Biden!]
%
Biden can only enter the White house as President if he can prove that his ridiculous "80,000,000 votes" were not fraudulently or illegally obtained. [Although, Trump has already proven this because of all the recounts and audits...]
%
People don’t know what a poll watcher is.
%
Biden did poorly in big cities (Politico), except those of Detroit (more votes than people!), Philadelphia, Atlanta and Milwaukee, which he had to win. Not surprisingly, they are all located in the most important swing states, and are long known for being politically corrupt!
%
When you see what happened in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia & Milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he’s got a big unsolvable problem!
%
Freedom of the Press is gone, a thing of the past.
%
No, the 2020 Election was a total scam, we won by a lot...
%
Just saw the vote tabulations. There is NO WAY Biden got 80,000,000 votes!!! This was a 100% RIGGED ELECTION.
%
They and the Fake News, working together, want to SILENCE THE TRUTH. Can’t let that happen. This is what Communist countries do!
%
Twitter is sending out totally false “Trends” that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. They make it up, and only negative “stuff”.
%
Primary point made was that the 2020 Election was RIGGED, and that I WON!
%
Corrupt Election!
%
Certainly I will [leave the Whitehouse if the Electoral College votes Biden as the winner of the election], and you know that. I will and, you know that.
%
It's going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud.
%
As to whether or not we can get this apparatus moving quickly -- because time isn't on our side, everything else is on our side, facts are on our side, this was a massive fraud.
%
[If Biden wins, the Electoral College] made a mistake, 'cause this election was a fraud.
%
One of the big things Democrats are gonna have to decide is-will they become a party that will accept the results of an election?
%
They call them dumps. Big massive dumps.
%
Watch @OANN, @newsmax, or almost anything else. You won’t have to suffer through endless interviews with Democrats, and even worse!
%
[Biden was] always known as a dummy. Now he's a dummy and a half.
%
NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!
%
@DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
%
Everybody knows it was Rigged.
%
I won Pennsylvania by a lot, perhaps more than anyone will ever know. The Pennsylvania votes were RIGGED. All other swing states also.
%
You have leaders of countries that call me, say, that's the most messed-up election we have ever seen.
%
You know what a glitch is. That's -- a glitch is supposed to be when a machine breaks down.
%
We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account. And these are glitches. So, they're not glitches.
%
I was called by the biggest people, saying, congratulations, political people. Congratulations, sir. You just won the election.
%
All of a sudden, I went from winning by a lot to losing by a little. [He lost by a lot.]
%
I said, well, I hear bad things about the machines. I hear bad things about corruption.
%
There are a lot of dead people that so-called voted in this election.
%
And how the FBI and Department of Justice -- I don't know. Maybe they are involved. But how people are allowed to get away from this stuff -- with this stuff is unbelievable. [These are run by Willam Barr... Trump's pick.]
%
I'm telling you, at 10:00, everybody thought it was over. [Nobody that understands how elections work thought this.]
%
You know, the poll watchers -- and this is true with all of the states, just about, that you're talking about, I think all of them. They weren't allowed to have poll watchers. [This was debunked in court weeks ago.]
%
And from what everybody is saying, and from what -- I don't think we even have to prove this. [You do have to, and you can't because it isn't true.]
%
I would like to file one nice, big, beautiful lawsuit, talking about this and many other things, with tremendous proof. [He would *like* to.]
%
There are so many different things.
%
Well, how come there are thousands of dead people voting? [There weren't. But some people died after delivering their ballots and before the election. Their votes were cancelled, as is the requirement.]
%
I know FBI.
%
It was a Russia, Russia hoax. It was just pure hoax. It was a pure hoax and a very -- a very sad thing for the country.
%
If I wasn't here, Antifa would be running this country right now. They'd be running the country.
%
And if I'm not here -- I'm sort of your wall. You know, we're completing the wall, like I said I would. Everyone said, you would never be able to do it.
%
We could have a great case. We do have a great case. We have the greatest case ever.
%
I came up with vaccines that people didn't think we'd have for five years. And we have them.
%
We're doing better than the rest of the world. We're doing better. [The US had more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world at this point.]
%
Massive fraud has been found. We're like a third-world country!
%
We must check signatures and count signed envelopes against ballots. Then call off election. It won’t be needed. We will all WIN!
%
Stupid people... like Cory Booker.
%
Pardon investigation is Fake News!
%
This election is a far bigger scandal (FRAUD!) than anyone would have thought - not even close.
%
Suppression Media!
%
They know it's true. they know it's there. They know who won the election, but they refuse to say "You're right..." Our country needs somebody to say "You're right..."
%
Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result. And I hope that Joe Biden is as well.
%
This is about restoring faith and confidence in American elections.
%
ALL THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS COVID, COVID, COVID. ON NOVEMBER 4th, YOU WON’T BE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IT ANYMORE. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN!!!
%
The only thing more RIGGED than the 2020 Presidential Election is the FAKE NEWS SUPPRESSED MEDIA. No matter how big or important the story, if it is even slightly positive for “us”, or negative for “them”, it will not be reported!
%
Spirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE!
%
Very sadly for our Nation, it looks like Senator @JimInhofe will not be putting the Section 230 termination clause into the Defense Bill. So bad for our National Security and Election Integrity. Last chance to ever get it done. I will VETO!
%
GET TOUGH REPUBLICANS!
%
Whistleblowers reveal that the USPS is responsible for tampering with hundreds of thousands of ballots. [Trump put the guy in charge. Now he's throwing him under the bus, too!]
%
People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in “voting” machines.
%
IF WE DON'T "ROOT OUT" ALLEGED VOTER FRAUD THEN "WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE"
%
It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost.
%
Get better [from Covid-19] soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!
%
Now spreading Fake News!
%
Suppression of thought!
%
...I WON THE ELECTION, BIG.
%
Even a boring football game, kneeling and all, is better!
%
We say MERRY CHRISTMAS proudly again! [They never weren't able to. This is yet another year this lie is continued.]
%
If you don’t vote. The socialists and the communists win.
%
Fraudulent result!
%
All I can do is run, campaign, and be a good (great!) President – it is 100% up to the states to manage the election. Republicans will NEVER forget this.
%
This [wearing a mask] will be voluntary. I don't think I'd be doing it.
%
Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. [The rightful person, of course, is Joe Biden.]
%
At 10:00 P.M. on Election Evening, we were at 97% win with the so-called “bookies”.
%
If somebody cheated in the Election, which the Democrats did, why wouldn’t the Election be immediately overturned? How can a Country be run like this?
%
No candidate has ever won both Florida and Ohio and lost. I won them both, by a lot!
%
We will be INTERVENING in the Texas (plus many other states) case. This is the big one. Our Country needs a victory!
%
Most corrupt Election in history, by far. We won!!!
%
I will not, under any circumstances, Pack the Court!
%
I just want to stop the world from killing itself!
%
The Swine Flu (H1N1), and the attempt for a vaccine by the Obama Administration, with Joe Biden in charge, was a complete and total disaster. Now they want to come in and take over one of the “greatest and fastest medical miracles in modern day history.” I don’t think so!
%
Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA. Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!
%
Oh well, it’s OK, we won the Election anyway - 75,000,000 VOTES!!!
%
No Presidential candidate ever came even close to losing an Election who won Iowa, Florida and Ohio. I won all three, by a lot! [Actually, Nixon lost the election, but won those very same states.]
%
WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!
%
The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!
%
Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
%
THE BIGGEST WINNER OF OUR NEW DEFENSE BILL IS CHINA!. I WILL VETO!
%
MOST CORRUPT ELECTION IN U.S. HISTORY!
%
How do states and politicians confirm an election where corruption and irregularities are documented throughout? A Swing State hustle!
%
We had no ammunition. I'll never forget a very overrated general coming to see me and saying, 'Sir, we have no ammunition, I'm sorry.'
%
We won Pennsylvania. We won Michigan. We won Georgia by a lot.
%
All of the bookies all over the world were saying the election's over. They wouldn't even take bets on it.
%
The election was over at 10:00 in the evening. [In Hawaii's time zone]
%
No, I worry about the country having an illegitimate president, that's what I worry about. A president that lost and lost badly. This wasn't like a close election. [At least he was right about it not being a close election.]
%
We won Georgia big. We won Pennsylvania big. We won Wisconsin big. We won it big.
%
I just got 75 million votes. The biggest number of votes in the history of our country ever gotten by a sitting president. I went from 63 million to 75 million, a 12-million vote difference. [And Biden WON. He received the largest number of votes of ANY CANDIDATE ever in US history.]
%
I pushed the FDA and companies and everybody else involved like nobody's ever been pushed before, and now you have it rolling out and frankly you could have done it last week. They could have even done it a week sooner if they heard from me.
%
“Why did the Swing States stop counting in the middle of the night?” @MariaBartiromo Because they waited to find out how many ballots they had to produce in order to steal the Rigged Election. They were so far behind that they needed time, & a fake “water main break”, to recover!
%
What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.
%
Consent Decree, which is terrible for Republicans (and honest people!), must be opened up NOW - David, Kelly, and I will then win!
%
[About Cleveland Indians changing their racist name] Oh no! What is going on? This is not good news, even for “Indians”. Cancel culture at work!
%
Swing States that have found massive VOTER FRAUD, which is all of them, CANNOT LEGALLY CERTIFY these votes as complete & correct without committing a severely punishable crime. [It was actually none of them. That's why Trump lost every one of his court cases except for one which was not even about criminal or otherwise illegal behaviour.]
%
VOTES CANNOT BE CERTIFIED. THIS ELECTION IS UNDER PROTEST!
%
Democrats would never put up with a Presidential Election stolen by the Republicans!
%
I have NOTHING to do with the potential prosecution of Hunter Biden, or the Biden family. It is just more Fake News. Actually, I find it very sad to watch!
%
The Vaccine and the Vaccine rollout are getting the best of reviews.
%
I went from 63,000,000 Votes to 75,000,000 Votes, a record 12,000,000 Vote increase. Obama went down 3,000,000 Votes, and won. Rigged Election!!!
%
Too soon to give up. Republican Party must finally learn to fight. People are angry!
%
Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded. [Yea, right...]
%
The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!). There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.
%
He didn’t win the Election. He lost all 6 Swing States, by a lot. They then dumped hundreds of thousands of votes in each one, and got caught. Now Republican politicians have to fight so that their great victory is not stolen. Don’t be weak fools!
%
Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!
%
I am very disappointed in the United States Supreme Court, and so is our great country!
%
We won Wisconsin big. They rigged the vote!
%
We had a landslide victory, and then it was swindled away from the Republican Party - but we caught them. Do something!
%
Two years ago, the great people of Wisconsin asked me to endorse a man named Brian Hagedorn for State Supreme Court Justice, when he was getting destroyed in the Polls against a tough Democrat Candidate who had no chance of losing. After my endorsement, Hagedorn easily won!... ...WOW, he just voted against me in a Big Court Decision on voter fraud (of which there was much!), despite many pages of dissent from three highly respected Justices. One thing has nothing to do with another, but we ended up losing 4-3 in a really incorrect ruling!
%
Big news coming out of Pennsylvania. Very big illegal ballot drop that cannot be accounted for. Rigged Election!
%
GREATEST ELECTION FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!!!
%
What would Bolton, one of the dumbest people in Washington, know?
%
The lie of the year is that Joe Biden won!
%
THE DEMOCRATS DUMPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS IN THE SWING STATES LATE IN THE EVENING. IT WAS A RIGGED ELECTION!!!
%
Our Country, and indeed the World, will soon see the great miracle of what the Trump Administration has accomplished. They said it couldn’t be done!!!
%
The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me.
%
I saved at least 8 Republican Senators, including Mitch, from losing in the last Rigged (for President) Election. Now they (almost all) sit back and watch me fight against a crooked and vicious foe, the Radical Left Democrats. I will NEVER FORGET!
%
Twitter is going wild with their flags, trying hard to suppress even the truth. Just shows how dangerous they are, purposely stifling free speech. Very dangerous for our Country. Does Congress know that this is how Communism starts?
%
VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, IT IS A FACT!!!
%
At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren’t the Republicans up in arms & fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election?
%
More than one million Americans have already received the China Virus Vaccine, a record pace!
%
He is the Messiah, the Lord. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes, and lying in a manger.
%
After seeing the massive Voter Fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, I disagree with anyone that thinks a strong, fast, and fair Special Counsel is not needed, IMMEDIATELY.
%
This was the most corrupt election in the history of our Country, and it must be closely examined!
%
Terrible people!
%
Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, “Mitch’s boy”, should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn’t like weakness.
%
THE DEMOCRATS DUMPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS IN THE SWING STATES LATE IN THE EVENING. IT WAS A RIGGED ELECTION!!!
%
We won in a LANDSLIDE!
%
At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!
%
[Tommy Tuberville] said, "You made me the most popular politician in the United States."
%
Increase payments to the people, get rid of the “pork”.
%
... send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package. And maybe that administration will be me.
%
Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won.
%
... when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country’s history...
%
The lockdowns in Democrat run states are absolutely ruining the lives of so many people - Far more than the damage that would be caused by the China Virus.
%
... stop the billions of dollars in “pork”.
%
Fake President!
%
If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death.
%
Increase payments to the people, get rid of the “pork”.
%
Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP.
%
Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!
%
Say goodbye to VITAL Section 230 termination, your National Monuments, Forts (names!) and Treasures (inserted by Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren), 5G, and our great soldiers being removed and brought home from foreign lands who do NOTHING for us.
%
....Please remember who got it done!!!
%
Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!
%
Massive amounts of evidence will be presented on the 6th. We won, BIG!
%
We now have far more votes than needed to flip Georgia in the Presidential race. Massive VOTER FRAUD took place.
%
It was a Rigged Election, one not even fit for third world countries!
%
Twitter is shadow banning like never before. A disgrace that our weak and ineffective political leadership refuses to do anything about Big Tech. They’re either afraid or stupid, nobody really knows!
%
@BrianKempGA should resign from office. He is an obstructionist who refuses to admit that we won Georgia, BIG! Also won the other Swing States.
%
The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!
%
The Wall Street Journal’s very boring & incoherent Editorial fails to mention my big & easy wins in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa & many other states that the @WSJ & other joke polls said I would lose.
%
I love the Great State of Georgia, but the people who run it, from the Governor, @BrianKempGA, to the Secretary of State, are a complete disaster and don’t have a clue, or worse. Nobody can be this stupid.
%
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. [Feb 3, 2016 - this is yet another old Trump pattern.]
%
The people of Georgia know that this was a scam, and because of what you've [Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger] done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote [in the runoffs].
%
A lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you [Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger] did to the president.
%
You [Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger] would be respected if this thing could be straightened out before the election.
%
All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.
%
Flipping the state is a great testament to our country; it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake, it was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia and it's not a problem that's going away.
%
We hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots.
%
There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.
%
Sorry, but the number of votes in the Swing States that we are talking about is VERY LARGE and totally OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE! Only the Democrats and some RINO’S would dare dispute this - even though they know it is true!
%
Something how Dr. Fauci is revered by the LameStream Media as such a great professional, having done, they say, such an incredible job, yet he works for me and the Trump Administration, and I am in no way given any credit for my work.
%
The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of @CDCgov’s ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low. “When in doubt, call it Covid.” Fake News!
%
The vaccines are being delivered to the states by the Federal Government far faster than they can be administered!
%
An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can’t let it happen!
%
For historical purposes remember, I was able to get rid of the INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, the most unpopular and expensive part of ObamaCare.
%
Some States are very slow to inoculate recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the Federal Government. They will get it done!
%
The people of Georgia are angry. The people in the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you've recalculated [the vote count]. [Except that it would be fraudulent.]
%
You know what they did and you're not reporting it. You know, that’s a criminal — that’s a criminal offense. And you know, you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you [Brad Raffensperger] and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk. [This sounds like extortion.]
%
The “Surrender Caucus” within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective “guardians” of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!
%
Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET!
%
“We are not acting to thwart the Democratic process, we are acting to protect it.”
%
It turns out …  that his brother, Ron Raffensperger, is the Chief Technical Officer for Huawei’s enterprise storage solutions company. And Huawei … has been sanctioned by the American government… [This is a lie, as Ron is not related to Brad, and certainly not brothers.]
%
I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. [Ryan Germany]
%
That's criminal. You know, that's criminal. Ok? That's another criminal. That's another of the many criminal events. Many criminal events here. Umm, I don't know brad. I got to get... to find 12,000 votes and I have them times a lot. Therefor I won the state.
%
The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.
%
How do you certify numbers that have now proven to be wrong and, in many cases, fraudulent!
%
"I hope Mike Pence comes through for us [to overturn the election results], I have to tell you. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much.
%
Do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County?
%
No this isn't social media. This is Trump media.
%
Washington is being inundated with people who don’t want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats.
%
I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order.
%
Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth! [tweeted during the Capitol building seige.]
%
These scoundrels are only toying with the @sendavidperdue (a great guy) vote. Just didn’t want to announce quite yet. They’ve got as many ballots as are necessary. Rigged Election!
%
The States want to redo their votes. They found out they voted on a FRAUD.
%
The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!
%
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO.
%
All Mike Pence has to do is send them [the votes] back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!
%
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is so happy with the fake voter tabulation process that he can’t even get the words out straight.
%
If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency.
%
Get smart Republicans. FIGHT! [Tweeted hours before supporters stormed the Capitol building.]
%
Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go!
%
Looks like they are setting up a big “voter dump” against the Republican candidates.
%
Antifa is a Terrorist Organization, stay out of Washington. Law enforcement is watching you very closely!
%
I hope the Democrats, and even more importantly, the weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen. [Tweeted hours before they stormed the Capitol building.]
%
You’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. [Moments before they stormed the Capitol building.]
%
These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. [Re: storming the Capitol building.]
%
We love you! You're very special. [to the rioters before Trump told them to march to the Capitol building.]
%
I will say, the people that are following me are very passionate.
%
We're going to have to fight much harder.
%
Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.
%
While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.
%
We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore, and that’s what this is all about. [Moments before the same crowd was prompted to walk to the Capitol, which resulted in a riot.]
%
[Mike Pence] stabbed me in the back [by declaring Biden the electoral winner].
%
We're going to the capitol, and we're going to try and give... the Democrats are hopeless. They're never voting for anything. Not even one vote... but we're going to try and give our republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. We're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you [Note: he didn't go with them.] We're going to walk down... we're going to walk down, anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the capitol. [Then they walked down Pennsylvania Avenue and stormed the Capitol building, as recommended by Trump.]
%
I immediately deployed the National Guiard and federal law enforcement to secure the building, and expel the intruders. [Actually, Trump resisted, so Pence made the call instead. It was 3 hours late.]
%
My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote.
%
To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.
%
We want normal life. Like 7 months ago...
%
The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!! [Afterward, Trump's account was permanently disabled by Twitter for continuing what he was previously temporarily barred for.]
%
Go home with love and in peace. Remember this day forever! [The Capitol siege?]
%
[Soleimani] is no longer a monster. He's dead.

How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's "birth certificate" died in plane crash today. All others lived.

Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don't have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)!

Great, now I can go after Horseface [Stormy Danials] and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will confirm the letter she signed!
%
The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy.
%
Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! [Making it sound like his followers are also somehow affected by it, but really he's only referring to himself and Melania.]
%
Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, & many tests of young people.
%
The big city machines are corrupt. This was a stolen election.
%
Great. Most corrupt election in history, by far. We won!!!
%
This impeachment is causing tremendous anger. I think it's causing tremendous danger to this country. ... I want no violence.
%
We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.
%
People thought that what I said [that triggered the Capitol building siege] was totally appropriate.
%
The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes, be careful of what you wish for. [Another dog whistle to his followers when asked about the 25th amendment.]
%
This movement doesn't go away.
%
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence? [Tweeted in 2014. Didn't age well.]
%
You know, under President Obama you had [child] separation. I was the one that ended it. [Trump actually started the child separation as a policy, ramped it up, and then lost ID of who the 650+ children belonged to.]
%
We did what we came here to do — and so much more. [No kidding...]
%
The American Dream was restored.
%
The world respects us again. Please don't lose that respect.
%
I know you like me, and this room is a love fest...
%
Trust me. I'm like a smart person.
%
You can either go down in history as a patriot or you can go down in history as a pussy. [re: Mike Pence]
%
This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.
%
We were not a regular administration.
%
Again, we put it in a position like it's never been before, despite the worst plague to hit since I'd guess you say 1917.
%
We got the vaccine developed in nine months instead of nine years or five years or 10 years, a long time. [Pfizer did it in partnership with a German company, and NOT the US Operation Warp Speed, as is claimed here.]
%
We passed VA Choice. [No, Obama did.]
%
We also got tax cuts, the largest tax cut and reform in the history of our country by far. [Actually, not even close to the largest.]
%
We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. [Actually, not even close to the largest.]
%
We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. [One of many lies.]
%
We have the greatest economy in the world. [One of many lies.]
%
[The economy is] a rocket ship up. [The opposite is true.]
%
We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the USA. [There are 60,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than during Obama's presidency.]
%
We obliterated the ISIS caliphate. [Except that they still exist, and still are a threat.]
%
I hope they don't raise your taxes, but if they do I told you so.
%
I don’t think I’ll be accepted [into the former-President's Club, which currently includes Carter, G W Bush, Obama]
%
You don't concede when there's theft involved.
%
Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with their hands tied behind their back.
%
You will never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength.
%
The radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless. And it's time that somebody did something about it.
%
Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappinted in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories.
%
This was a fraudulent election. But we can't play into the hands of these people. So go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel.
%
Remember this day [The storming of the Capitol building] forever!
%
Our army took over the airports. They did what they had to do. [He's talking about something that happened 250 years ago. There were no airports 250 years ago.]
%
Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are. [re: the Capitol Building seige]
%
It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters, and transform justice into a tool of political vengeance.
%
...yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.
%
No president has ever gone through anything like it, and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people, the highest number ever for a sitting president, who voted for us just a few short months ago. [It was only 74.2 million. Biden won with 81.2 million votes. A landslide.]
%
The historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun.
%
In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people. There has never been anything like it!
%
Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again.
%
This is a big moment for our country, and we cannot let it pass by using third rate 'leaders' [Mitch McConnell] to dictate our future!
%
I can get you home in two hours if you want. [Offering Kim Jong Un a ride on Air Force One after a failed summit.]
%
I have very big [tax] returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time.
%
What happened at 3:02 in the morning? [After the vote count... nothing happened.]
%
We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit, we seem to have more votes than we have people. A lot more votes. An election changing number. [Still claiming the already debunked story.]
%
In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting.
%
Your family still can't go out to eat at local restaurants, but Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world. People that nobody knows anything about.
%
Joe Biden sold out America's children to the teachers unions.
%
They should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to our country ... the Supreme Court didn't have the guts or the courage to do anything about it. [Trump was asking them to break the law.]
%
I may even decide to beat [the Democrats] for a third time.
%
Already the Biden administration has proved that they are anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science.
%
Do you miss me yet? Do you miss me?
%
We've been doing a lot of winning.
%
Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody's ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That's all of us. It's all of us.
%
[Biden's] campaign was all lies.
%
He wants windmills, the windmills ... the windmills that don't work when you need 'em.
%
Who loves you as much as I love you?
%
I fought like hell to save your Second Amendment, and we saved it 100%.
%
I will tell you something and I said, had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different.
%
[Windmills are] such an expensive form of energy. It's so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes. [coal mines aren't?]
%
We won the election twice. I mean, you know, think about it.
%
Many people have asked what is 'Trumpism' ... What it means is great deals, great trade deals, great ones.
%
We started hearing 'we love you' and I asked somebody, you know, because we really liked Ronald Reagan, right? We had others. But I said, did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great? And to the best of all of these political professionals' knowledge and pollsters, nobody has ever heard that chant before.
%
When you think about it, we love you, you are saying that about -- I hate to say it. Am I a politician? I don't know, maybe I'm a politician.
%
We can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again. Can never let that happen again.
%
Republicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country.
%
This election was rigged. And the Supreme Court and other courts didn't want to do anything about it.
%
And the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick or out of the country or military where they can't do it. One day. [Trump voted by mail in 2020]
%
I got more votes -- I got more -- and which is me -- when I say 'I,' I'm talking about we. We -- we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes.
%
And then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be. I wonder who that will be. Who, who, who will that be, I wonder?
%
Never let them forget this was us. We did this. [re: Trump GOP overseeing the rapid development of Covid vaccines.]
%
[Jarod and Ivanka are] two incredible people. I can't believe they're not working (few work harder)!
%
I do not know where other people will be next year, but I know where I will be -- in Alaska campaigning against a disloyal and very bad Senator [Lisa Murkowski, who voted against him for impeachment].
%
No more money for RINOS. They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base--they will never lead us to Greatness. Send your donation to Save America PAC at DonaldJTrump.com. We will bring it all back stronger than ever before! [Isn't he being investigated for campaign fund shenanigans?]
%
I fully support the Republican Party and important GOP Committees, but I do not support RINOs and fools, and it is not their right to use my likeness or image to raise funds.
%
When the right answer comes out, you'll be praised. [Coercing Chief Investigator Frances Watson to overturn election results in Georgia.]
%
I won everything but Georgia. And I won Georgia, I know that. By a lot. And the people know it. And something happened there. Something bad happened. [The only bad thing that heppened was all the money wasted trying to sow doubt on the election process.]
%
If you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you are going to find things that are going to be unbelievable.
%
The dishonesty that we've heard from...
%
I think we're doing an incredible job [on dealing with Covid]. So I don't want to disturb them, bother them [Trump's predecessors]. I don't think I'm going to learn much.
%
Some of [the insurrectionists] went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships.
%
[The insurrection] was zero threat, right from the start, it was zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn't have done it.
%
A lot of the people [insurrectionists] were waved in, and then they walked in and they walked out.
%
[Lisa Murkowski] represents her state badly and her country even worse.
%
I said to one of my friends, a very wealthy friend, I said, 'You know, I'll bet you [being president] cost me $2 or 3 billion and it's worth every penny of it.
%
I don't need the money and [being president was] worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country.
%
This thing is costing me a fortune, being president.
%
[It] cost me billions of dollars to be president of the United States.
%
[Mitch McConnell is a] stone cold loser.
%
If that were [Chuck] Shumer instead of this dumb sone of a bitch Mitch McConnell, they would never allow [the electoral votes] to happen. They would have fought it.
%
[Mitch McConnel is] a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack.
%
I hired [Mitch McConnell's] wife. Did he ever say thank you? She suffered so greatly.
%
[The COVID19 vaccines should all be called] Trumpcine.
%
[Fauci is] so full of crap.
%
Happy Easter to ALL, including the Radical Left CRAZIES who rigged our Presidential Election, and want to destroy our Country!
%
I have a great relationship with a certain man that's got great power over North Korea.
%
The Russian hoax was very, very bad for the relationship that we would have with Russia.
%
The wall is imperative. All of the things that go with the wall, the technology that goes into the wall and with the wall is so imperative.
%
One other thing, they're sending us not their best people. They are sending us people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and really bad -- rapists, really bad people.
%
So many different things that -- look, we got 75 million votes. It's more than any sitting president in history by far.
%
Usually in a second term a president gets less votes. I got 12 million more. It's the biggest that's ever happened in history, from 63 to 75. Never happened before. And all of these things are good.
%
Lisa Murkowski is a disaster. I mean, she's a total disaster.
%
I was making calls getting congressmen elected.
%
You know, I cut taxes more than any president's ever cut taxes.
%
We did a great job [with COVID19 response]. We got very little credit for the great job we've done.
%
I'll give you a little breaking news. Pfizer is in with the FDA. And what the FDA did with Johnson & Johnson is so stupid.
%
You know, I can be liked by everybody. But I won't be doing a good job.
%
I think it's very suspect is what they did with Johnson & Johnson, because the only people that are happy about that are Pfizer and Moderna. The only people that are happy about that because what they did is a terrible, terrible thing.
%
I tell you that at least eight senators would have lost their race. I could name them but I don't want to embarrass them but that includes Mitch, who is heading south.
%
Almost everybody I endorse wins.
%
I love doing it because I help people. And I've helped them more than any president with the cutting of taxes, with the regulations, with right to try.
%
And I've added something called Space Force. It's going to be so powerful, so important.
%
I got tremendous numbers. Nobody has ever gotten the numbers I got. No sitting president has come even close. There's more popularity now than there was the day before the election...
%
Liz Cheney is polling sooo low in Wyoming, and has sooo little support, even from the Wyoming Republican Party, that she is looking for a way out of her Congressional race.
%
[Liz Cheney will] either be yet another lobbyist or maybe embarrass her family by running for President, in order to save face.
%
Why is it that every time the 2020 ELECTION FRAUD is discussed, the Fake News Media consistently states that such charges are baseless, unfounded, unwarranted, etc.?
%
Sadly, there was massive fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, and many very angry people understand that.
%
Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections.
%
They rigged and stole our 2020 Presidential Election, which we won by a landslide
%
We will not become a Socialist Nation.
%
Happy Easter to ALL, including the Radical Left CRAZIES who rigged our Presidential Election, and want to destroy our Country!
%
Except for massive voter fraud, this was a campaign that was easily won by your favorite Republican President, me!
%
The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!
%
So nice to see RINO Mitt Romney booed off the stage at the Utah Republican State Convention. They are among the earliest to have figured this guy out, a stone cold loser!
%
Liz Cheney is a warmongering fool who has no business in Republican Party Leadership.
%
Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth...
%
These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.
%
Had Mike Pence referred the information on six states (only need two) back to State Legislatures, and had gutless and clueless MINORITY Leader Mitch McConnell (he blew two seats in Georgia that should have never been lost) fought to expose all of the corruption that was presented at the time, with more found since, we would have had a far different Presidential result...
%
The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED.
%
Sometimes there are consequences to being ineffective and weak. The voters understand.
%
If you can... be elected to do that job by partisan voters who wish to enact political retribution, then we are no longer a free constitutional democracy.
%
These democrasts want to silence and cancel millions of voters because they don't want "Trump" to run again.
%
Our movement, which started with the Great Election Win of 2016, is perhaps the biggest and most powerful in the history of our Country.
%
Love Donald Trump or hate him, there is no denying that he oversaw the obliteration of our former conception of what constituted full employment.
%
The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED! This is illegal and the Arizona State Senate, who is leading the Forensic Audit, is up in arms.
%
The Mainstream Media and Radical Left Democrats want to stay as far away as possible from the Presidential Election Fraud, which should be one of the biggest stories of our time.
%
"Let's stay home Darling. We love our President, but he can't win."
%
As our Country is being destroyed, both inside and out, the Presidential Election of 2020 will go down as THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY!
%
Everyone is so tired of watching Karl Rove on Fox News... He's totally ineffective and does not represent the MAGA Movement in any way, shape or form.

[Karl Rove] called me on the evening of November 3rd, Election Night, to congratulate me on my "great win." When it was revealed the election was rigged and stolen, he flew the coop.
%
Donate your money far more wisely at [my website].

Isn't it incredible that because of the vaccines, which I and my Administration came up with years ahead of schedule (despite the fact that everybody, including Fauci, said would never happen), that we no longer need masks...?
%
The Fake News and Lamestream Media... don't want the United States or World to see what is going on with our corrupt, third world election.
%
A guy named Miles Taylor, who I have no idea who he is, don't remember ever meeting him or having a conversation with... is the guy who fraudulently wrote a make-believe book and statement to the failing New York Times calling himself "Anonymous."

[Liz Cheney will] either be yet another lobbyist or maybe embarrass her family by running for President, in order to save face.

State police or National Guard must be immediately sent out for protection. The Democrats do not want to have this information revealed, and they will do anything to stop it. [Only the Republicans have involved themselves with the type of violence they brought about on Jan 6, 2021.]

Liz Cheney... couldn't care less about our brave soldiers overseas, and... is willing to fight ridiculous, endless wars instead of preparing for the Big Time enemies that may someday soon face our Country. [So Trump wants the soldiers out, then blames Biden for the obvious violence that follows...]

We came down that beautiful gold escalator in Trump Tower and I made that statement and people hated it. It turned out that my statement was very minor compared to the actual facts.

We handed the new administration the greatest economy in the history of the world.

Democrats push economic policies designed to punish American workers.

[Dr. Fauci is] not a great doctor, but he’s a hell of a promoter.

 They want to keep me happy. I don’t think they want to keep Biden happy. I don’t think they care too much about Biden to be honest.
%
I’ll guarantee you those cameras are starting to go off right now. It’s true. Yeah. Those red lights. Well, there’s one over there. What the hell network are you with? This guy’s going to lose his job. [in 2021 you'd think he might retire this schtick finally.]

The Biden Administration has been one shameful and embarrassing foreign policy disaster after another.

War is inevitable. Nuclear war we’re talking about.

Israel’s almost out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very terrible thing.

I’ll never forget that ramp. That was like a sheet of ice.

Under my administration. America was respected again, totally respected.
%
We are looked upon as not very smart people and not a very smart country.
%
In Texas, I said, “We’re going to win.” We won Texas by a lot. We won Texas, but they were against oil, guns, and God.
%
We have to have that power to keep and bear arms. If we don’t, we will have a problem like nobody’s ever seen before.
%
We have a group of people, I don’t know where they come from, but it’s Hell, I think.
%
The left is willing to weaponize the law itself to persecute their political opponents.

Look at the Mueller scam. How well did he do before Congress? It wasn’t too good, was it?

All you have to do is read the article in Time magazine, cover story in Time magazine. I’m not a big fan, I was on the cover a lot, perhaps a record, a lot.
%
It’ll be very interesting, but I’ll tell you, and maybe they’ll find nothing. Maybe they’ll say, oh, it was a wonderful, perfect election, but maybe not.
%
We can’t let our country be run by that kind of human nature can we?
%
I can’t believe that some of these states that are blue, that they’re blue. I know those people, they’re smart people. And I see so many people.
%
If you don’t have election integrity and if you don’t have strong borders, our country can be run like a dictatorship and that’s what they’d like to do.
%
I don’t even think Biden is the dictator. If anybody knows who the hell is running that operation, could you let us know? Because I don’t think it’s Joe but who the hell knows maybe it is. Maybe it is.
%
I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one that’s trying to save it, please remember that.
%
We all know what happened with the election and we can never ever let that happen again.
%
What happened to this country in that last election was a disgrace and it’s being laughed at, and viewed all over the world.
%
I will not be endorsing, under any circumstances, the failed candidate from the great State of Alaska, Lisa Murkowski.
%
Max [Miller]'s opponent is a guy named Anthony Gonzalez, who's bad news. He's a grandstanding RINO, not respected in DC, who voted for the unhinged, unconstitutional illegal impeachment witch hunt.
%
[Max Miller is] a sellout, he's a fake Republican, and a disgrace to your state, I will tell you that.
%
Max Miller isn't fit to represent our community in Congress, and the campaign, as it develops, will bear this out.
%
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
%
Max’s opponent is a guy named Anthony Gonzalez. [Apparently a RINO: Republican in Name Only]

They used Covid in order to rig the election and in order to steal the election.

[After being told the insurrectionists weren't Antifa, but were Trump supporters] Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.
%
Never before has New York City and their prosecutors or perhaps any prosecutors criminally charged a company or a person for fringe benefits. ["Fringe benefits" is his new euphemism for corruption?]
%
But for murder, and for selling massive amounts of the worst drugs in the world that kill people left and right, that's OK. Think of it, think of how unfair it is [to go after me for corruption. Pure whataboutism.]
%
This was an election where the person that counts the votes was far more important than the candidate.
%
They failed to call out the late night ballot stuffing that took place in Georgia.
%
We were doing so well until the rigged election happened to come along.
%
The big tech giants worked together to suppress and diminish news coverage that was negative for Joe Biden.
%
I've listened to these people with so-called intelligence go on and on, and, quite frankly, it's a waste of time.

Whoever did that, [leaked that Trump hid in his bunker to avoid a George Floyd protest] they should be charged with treason! They should be executed!
%
I never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our Government. So ridiculous!
%
Sorry to inform you, but an Election is my form of 'coup,' and if I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley.
%
I know the fucking krauts. I was raised by the biggest kraut of them all.

Some of the stars I produced are actually made of garbage.

[Biden isn't] doing well at all. He's way behind schedule, and people are refusing to take the Vaccine because they don't trust his Administration, they don't trust the Election results, and they certainly don't trust the Fake News, which is refusing to tell the Truth.

First of all, can you imagine if I were president right now, and we had this massive attack from the coronavirus - no no, they like to call it the - they have new names, and they have other new names, but it's exactly what we had - we had the same thing.

Does everybody here understand that the 2020 election was a total disgrace?
%
Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do. I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible.

It was an amazing phone call. 40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and it was, actually before the World Trade Center, the tallest. And when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest and now it's the tallest. [re: 911]

Obama is probably running the government now anyway, according to many.

We're not going to lose this, except if they cheat. That's the way I look at it.

I don't care about my legacy. My legacy doesn't matter. If I lose, that will be my legacy. My people expect me to fight and if I don't, I'll lose them.

Too bad that sleaze bag publishers continue to report this very boring garbage. We and the MAGA movement are totally used to it. And someday in the not too distant future we will have our voice back and be treated fairly by the press.

One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren't going to do anything to overturn the election.

The real insurrection happened on November 3rd, the Presidential Election, not on January 6th—which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results.
%
During my administration, everybody wanted the vaccine. There was nobody saying oh, gee, I don't want to take it. Now they say that. And that's because they don't trust the Biden administration. I can think of no other reason. But they say we don't want it, we aren't going to take it. When I was there, everybody wanted it and we were doing great.
%
Mitch McConnell should have challenged that election, because even back then we had plenty of material to challenge that election. He should have challenged the election.
%
If we don't solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020, which we have thoroughly and conclusively documented, Republicans will not be voting in '22 or '24. It's the single most important thing for Republicans to do.
%
Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media. Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO, if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!
%
Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump? I'm like a Ph.D. in litigation.

Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.

Without MAGA, [Youngkin] would have lost by 15 points, more ... instead of giving us credit, they say, 'Oh he's more popular than [Trump].
%
So I said, 'Let me handle it. This is easy.' I got this guy [Brian Kemp] elected. I said, 'Brian, listen, you have a big election integrity problem in Georgia. I hope you can help us out and call a special election and let's get to the bottom of it for the good of the country.
%
[Brian Kemp] is a disaster!
%
It is more illegal for you than it is for them, because, you [Secretary of State] know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to [General Council Ryan Germany], your lawyer.
%
Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me.
%
They attacked and cheated on our elections. Now the people of Georgia must replace the RINOs and weak Republicans who made it all possible.
%
One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren't going to do anything to overturn the election.
%
[Mike Pence] was very arrogant.
%
Very sad that the RINOs in the House and Senate gave Biden and Democrats a victory on the "Non-Infrastructure" Bill.
%
All Republicans who voted for Democrat longevity should be ashamed of themselves, in particular Mitch McConnell, for granting a two month stay which allowed the Democrats time to work things out at our Country's, and the Republican Party's, expense!
%
I thought he was well protected and I had heard that he was in good shape," Trump told Karl. [on why Trump didn't check in on Pence during the insurrection.]
%
It's common sense that you're supposed to protect. How can you -- if you know a vote is fraudulent, right -- how can you pass on a fraudulent vote?
%
The real insurrection happened on November 3rd, the Presidential Election, not on January 6th – which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results.
%
Saving America starts by saving the GOP from RINOs, sellouts and known losers!
%
Sloppy Steve Bannon cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Are you going to say you got it from me? [To Chris Christie when he discovered he also had Covid.]
%
Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well.
%
This was all allowed by Mitch McConnell's incompetence and now I understand that a couple Republican Senators may get on board so that they can have yet another and even bigger victory, for the Democrats, while at the same time ensuring massive Inflation and the destruction of our Country as we know it.
%
Now the Democrats have a big victory and the wind at their back.
%
Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me.
%
[Kyle Rittenhouse] should have not have had to suffer through a trial for that. He was going to be dead.
%
Great job by Kevin McCarthy last night, setting a record by going over 8 hours of speaking on the House Floor in order to properly oppose Communism. We must never forget what the Democrats have done, at the highest level of evil.

If Mitch McConnell had fought, you would have a different Republican President right now.
%
I'm going to see who [Kevin McCarthy] is funding, and if he is, I'll stop the whole deal. I'll stop it.
%
It is my honor to receive the honorary [black belt Taekwondo 9th degree] dan certificate and I think Taekwondo is a magnificent martial art for self-defense.

The story of me having COVID prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News.

The MAGA base will just not vote for [Kemp] after what he did with respect to Election Integrity and two horribly run elections, for President and then two Senate seats.
%
If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment? The mob takes the Fifth.
%
It was early. OK? Let's put it this way -- [Netanyahu] greeted [Biden] very early. Earlier than most world leaders. I've not spoken to him since. Fuck him!
%
There was no one who did more for Netanyahu than me. There was no one who did for Israel more than I did. And the first person to run to greet Joe Biden was Netanyahu. And not only did he congratulate him -- he did it in a video.
%
There was love in the air [during the Jan 6 insurrection].
%
Israel literally owned Congress...10 years ago, 15 years ago... and today it's almost the opposite.
%
There's people in this country that are Jewish and no longer love Israel.
%
I'll tell you, the Evangelical Christians love Israel more than the Jews in this country.
%
It used to be that Israel had absolute power over Congress, and today I think it's the exact opposite. And I think Obama and Biden did that.
%
Jewish people, and I've said this for a long time, the Jewish people in the United States either don't like Israel or don't care about Israel.
%
The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with ... Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.
%
I'm not against [getting a Covid booster shot], but it's probably not for me.
%
Look, we did something that was historic. We saved tens of millions of lives worldwide. We -- together. All of us, not me.
%
If you don't want to take [a Covid vaccine], you shouldn't be forced to take it. No mandates. But take credit, because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don't let them take that away from you.
%
I came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines. All are very, very good. Came up with three of them in less than nine months.
%
I don't like to see the kids with the masks on. They're sitting in school, they have a hard enough time sitting in school.
%
I will be having a news conference on January 6th [anniversary of the Capitol siege] at Mar-a-Lago to discuss all of these points, and more.
%
People are refusing to take the vaccine because they don't trust his administration, they don't trust the election results, and they certainly don't trust the Fake News, which is refusing to tell the truth.
%
I came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines. All are very, very good. Came up with three of them in less than nine months.
%
Jacky Eubanks has taken it upon herself to go out and document voter fraud. This courageous young woman went door-to-door in Macomb County and Detroit asking voters if they really voted, and she is finding further proof of the rampant Election Fraud in 2020.

The currency of this world should be the dollar. I think they should regulate [Bitcoins] very, very high.
%
The launch of Melania's new NFT business epitomizes our American Spirit of ingenuity, creativity, and entrepreneurship.

The future doesn't belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.
%
Look at all of the people fighting for me [during the insurrection].
%
The real number [of people who showed up at the Jan 6 rally] was over that sacred number, you know what that number was.
%
Bing bong bing bing.
%
I hate mosquitos.
%
Is [Senator Mike Rounds] crazy or just stupid? The numbers are conclusive, and the fraudulent and irregular votes are massive.
%
Even though [Senator Mike Rounds'] election will not be coming up for 5 years, I will never endorse this jerk again.
%
The Radical Left Democrats and RINOS, like ‘Senator’ Mike Rounds, do not make it easy for our Country to succeed. He is a weak and ineffective leader, and I hereby firmly pledge that he will never receive my Endorsement again!
%
They're finding things no one thought possible. This was a corrupt election.
%
The mandate is really hurting our country. A lot of Americans aren't standing for it, and it's hurting our country.
%
Mitch McConnell is a loser.
%
[Mitch McConnell] is a dumb son of a bitch.
%
[Republicans accepted that the election was not rigged] because they're RINOs, and frankly, a lot of people are questioning that.
%
When you look at Langhofer, I disagree with him as an attorney. I did not think he was a good attorney to hire.
%
The Office of the Attorney General has been reduced to nothing more than the right arm of the Democratic party.
%
It’s gonna stop, because frankly, we’ve assembled the best legal, ethical minds, and we’re going to sue [Attorney General Letitia James] for this abuse of power.
%
I think it would have been much better for the country. I also think it would have been better for Mike [Pence if he were to block certification of Biden's presidential win.]
%
[O'Connell] has all the cards to win, but no guts to play them. Instead he gives our country away, just like he did with the two senate seats in Georgia, and the presidency itself.
%
How can this guy [McConnell] stay as leader is beyond comprehension. This is not only from me, but from virtually everyone in the Republican Party.
%
Like all Americans, I was outraged and sickened by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem [at the insurrection].
%
America is, and must always be, a nation of law and order.
%
To those who engaged in acts of violence and destruction [at the insurrection], I want to be very clear: you do not represent me. You do not represent our movement. You do not represent our country. And if you broke the law, you belong in jail.
%
I came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines. All are very, very good.
%
My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with the markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings, but I try.
%
You know damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
%
We're going to kick the Biden crime family out of the White House in 2024.
%
Remember, there are far more of us than there are of them.
%
The 2020 election was rigged. And everyone knows it.
%
They want to put me jail. They want to put me in jail.
%
These prosecutors are horrible people.
%
If these radical vicious racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we're going to have a discussion, the biggest protest we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere because our country and our elections are corrupt. They're corrupt.
%
If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.
%
We are going to take back the White House.
%
These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They're racists and they're very sick. They're mentally sick. They're going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they're not after me, they're after you.
%
How come the Democrats and Republicans, like Wacky Susan Collins, are desperately trying to pass legislation that will not allow the vice president to change the results of the election?
%
Actually what they are saying is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately he didn't exercise that power. He could have overturned the election!
%
Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher.
%
I would absolutely give [the insurrectionists] a pardon. [Their punishment is] 20 times out of proportion. These people are being persecuted.
%
Just saw Mike Pence's statement on the fact that he had no right to do anything with respect to the Electoral Vote Count, other than being an automatic conveyor belt for the Old Crow Mitch McConnell to get Biden elected President as quickly... I was right and everyone knows it.
%
The Freedom Convoy is peacefully protesting the harsh policies of far left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates.
%
We want those great Canadian truckers to know that we are with them all the way.
%
I think [Putin's] done a really great job of outsmarting our country.
%
You have to take out their families. When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. But they say they don't care about their lives. You have to take out their families.
%
This is genius. Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine, of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful!
%
So Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That's the strongest peace force. We could use that on our southern border. That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. ... Here's a guy who's very savvy. ... I know him very well. Very, very well.
%
The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.
%
Politically, I guess, you see the polls, and the polls for me have never been higher.
%
The polls have been extraordinary: 96% approval rating — and saw one this morning, 98%, but 96% approval rating — in the Republican Party and doing well with independents, doing well with women, doing well with everybody.
%
Who could forget the border? Millions of people, not two million or one million, like they say.
%
Many of these [immigrants] come from prisons. They're being let out.
%
But many of these countries are emptying their prisons like we're a dumping ground right into our country. I've never seen anything like it.
%
You can take the five worst presidents in the history of our country and put them together; I don't think they've done the damage that this administration has done.
%
Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn't be there and a man that has no concept of what he's doing.
%
So, Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper.
%
Here's a guy [Putin] who's very savvy. ... I know him very well. Very, very well.
%
Well, I'd rather see them send soldiers to our southern border. I'd rather see them ... In three weeks, you could finish it.
%
I knew Putin very well. I got along with him great. He liked me. I liked him. I mean, you know, he's a tough cookie, got a lot of the great charm and a lot of pride.
%
I think he sees this opportunity. I knew that [Putin] always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, 'You can't do it. You're not gonna do it.' But I could see that he wanted it.
%
I think nobody probably knows him better in terms of the discussions that we have or that we're having this morning. So, I knew him very well.
%
So, when we heard about this [Covid-19], nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had any idea -- other than I said very early on it came, obviously it came from the Wuhan lab, and I took a lot of heat.
%
You know, when you see body bags lying all over the place around the Wuhan lab, it's not that hard a guess, a guesstimate.
%
So, I heard about it, and we really mobilized fast, and we made a lot of great decisions. [Remember: "We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."]
%
Fauci wasn't a big player in my administration because I made the decisions.
%
[A ventilator is] a very complicated machine — more complicated, believe it or not, than building a car.
%
Everybody wanted the vaccine. And once I was out, all the sudden people didn't want it.
%
Canada is very unhappy, and Mexico is very unhappy. You know, in a way, that makes me feel good. In another way, I'd like them to be happy.
%
I hope [Biden] does great for the country. I think it's too late because I don't think he can do great for the country.
%
There's been so much damage done that I think if he turned out to be George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined, I think the net result is so bad, I just don't think he can do it.
%
When [Hilary Clinton's] shoes fell off, when she couldn't lift her foot up in, she couldn't walk, she kept falling down going into the airplanes.
%
So, I think you'll be happy. ... Campaign finance laws, so you can't talk about this stuff, so I won't. But I think you'll be happy. I really believe you'll be happy. [Trump "not" saying he plans on running for president again.]
%
Twitter is boring as hell now.
%
Their minds are blowing because Trump has the name 'truth.' So there's five letters, and what's better than 'truth?'
%
We're gonna come back, we're gonna come back strong, we'll be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Something's gonna happen.
%
I think [Putin] wanted to do something and negotiate [about Ukraine], and it got worse and worse, and then he saw the [American's] weakness.
%
We could use that [Russian military buildup around Ukraine] on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace, all right.
%
Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This [invasion of Ukraine] would never have happened.
%
You know what the response was from Biden [re: invasion of Ukraine]? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad.
%
Basically, I wish [Biden] luck [in the letter left for re winning the presidency] and, you know, it was a couple of pages long and it was from the heart because I want to see him do well. Look, he's there.
%
We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent?
%
We are bringing back our country and we are bringing back our freedom. [Apparently USA, but this was on day 4 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.]
%
Voters will stand up to left-wing fascists. [Apparently USA, but this was on day 4 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.]
%
We did it [won the presidency] twice, and we'll do it again.
%
That's a lot of fake news, look at all of those cameras.
%
You could take the five worst presidents in history, and they wouldn't have done the damage President Joe Biden has done in such a short time.
%
Joe Biden has turned calm into chaos. Stability into anarchy.
%
Putin is saying ‘oh they're going to sanction me, they sanctioned me for the last 25 years.’ You mean, I can take over a whole country and they're going to sanction me? You mean they're not going to blow us to pieces at least psychologically?
%
The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he's smart, but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb.
%
I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country.
%
Putin is playing Biden like a drum.
%
We're not the United States. We're considered a dumping ground for criminals.
%
The emergency [pandemic] is over and we will submit to this left-wing tyranny no longer.
%
[Democrats are waging a] demented witch hunt against me, my family, my staff, my supporters and you.
%
We're going to kick the Biden crime family out of the White House,
%
If your case is non-discriminatory, why don't you approve for everybody? ... You're saying only Indians can have the reservations, only Indians can have the gaming. So why aren't you approving it for everybody. Why are you being discriminatory? Why is it that the Indians don't pay tax but everybody else does? I do. Why is it that I pay for tax? Why is it that senior citizens get tremendous benefits from tax?
%
The secret of a really good tweet is just the right amount of crazy.
%
Taiwan is next [for invasion].
%
Will [Putin] become my new best friend?
%
[The United States should] put the Chinese flag on F-22 fighter jets and bomb the shit out of Russia. And then we say, China did it. Then they start fighting with each other, and we sit back and watch.
%
[Kim Jong Un] is absolutely the leader of that country.
%
Well, and I said this a long time ago, if this happens, we are playing right into their hands. Green energy. The windmills. They don't work. They're too expensive. They kill all the birds. [Trump's reply when asked about how he thought the situation in Ukraine might turn out.]
%
I want to see the ocean, I do not want to see windmills.
%
I am an expert on tourism.
%
If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value. And they say the noise causes cancer.
%
I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much.
%
If you have a ventilator, and it's working beautifully, I don't like the answer.
%
Getting Critical Race Theory out of our schools is not just a matter of values, it's also a matter of national survival. We have no choice. The fate of any nation ultimately depends on the willinness of its citizens to lay down, and they must do this lay down their very lives to defed their country. If we allow the Marxists and Communists and Socialists to teach our children to hate America, there will be no one left to defend our flag or to protect our great country or its freedom.
%
In 2024 we are going to take back that beautiful, beautiful Whitehouse. I wonder who will do that. I wonder.
%
We have a president representing our country at the most important time in history who is physically and mentally challenged.
%
Nobody can look at the bloodshed [in Ukraine] much longer. What's happening. It's a lack of respect for a lot of people, a lot of things, but it's just a total lack of respect. And it happens to be a man that is just driven. He's driven to put it together, and you look at it and it's just so ridiculous and so senseless, and so...
%
Remember with Ukraine, I sent the Javelins that you see are so effective against the tanks. Biden didn't, and in fact, he ended our last order. Probably it'll get there because everyone realized it was the right thing to do.
%
Pure, unflinching courages [he probably meant carriages, but that's just as weird] coursing through our veins. A beautiful, beautiful blood red, white and blue.
%
Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went 'woke' and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, 'Put that behind you, put that behind you,'
%
Mo, you just blew the Election, and there's nothing you can do about it.
%
The smartest one gets to the top. That didn't work so well recently in our country. But they ask me, 'Is Putin smart?' Yes, Putin was smart. And I actually thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, 'That's a hell of a way to negotiate, put 200,000 soldiers on the border.
%
They say, 'Trump said Putin's smart.' I mean, he's taking over a country for two dollars' worth of sanctions. I'd say that's pretty smart. He's taking over a country -- really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.
%
Yesterday reporters asked me if I thought President Putin was smart. I said, 'Of course, he's smart,' to which I was greeted with 'Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say.' I like to tell them, 'Yes, he's smart.'
%
Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn't it? You don't have this problem in Russia but we do.
%
How is it that the mayor of Moscow, his wife, gave the Biden family three and a half million dollars? I think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer. I’m sure he knows.
%
Republicans that happen to like Donald Trump -- MAGA Republicans -- are not going to go and vote for this guy Kemp.
%
This is genius. Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine -- of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful.
%
I'd say that's pretty smart. [Putin is] taking over a country -- really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.
%
Some people say my greatest achievement was getting the vaccine because the vaccine was said to take 3 to 5 years and most people said it wasn't gonna happen.
%
I knew Putin very well. You know, they say "Oh, he knows Putin. He knows Putin. Oh." That's a good thing. Not a bad thing. I know Kim Jong-un. I know President Xi of China.
%
You know, every time I say somebody is smart, they always go, "Oh Trump said that President Xi of China is smart." Well, you know he runs 1.5 billion people with an iron fist. Yeah! I think he's pretty smart.
%
Be a lot easier for me to say, "Oh." Be a lot easier for me to do like many people have done: get up and just say, "Congratulations, whoever it is I'm running against." I mean, if you're running, I'd say, "Congratulations, Joe."
%
I have known Dr. Oz for many years, as have many others, even if only through his very successful television show. He has lived with us through the screen and has always been popular, respected and smart.
%
When you're in television for 18 years, that's like a poll. That means people like you.
%
Well, I watch the shows [for military advice]. I mean, I really see a lot of great, you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows, and you have the generals.
%
I've got to be the cleanest, I think I'm the most honest human being, perhaps, that God has ever created.
%
You know, you've been investigated years and years, millions and millions of pages of documents, they found nothing.
%
Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.
%
There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.
%
I play to people's fantasies.
%
People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts.
%
People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.
%
[We will] demand justice for the January 6 prisoners and full protection of their civil rights — like was received by Antifa and Black Lives Matter, who murdered people throughout our country.
%
As you probably have heard, one of the first January 6th trials ended in an extortion.
%
Secret Service said I couldn’t go. I would have gone there [to the Capitol insurrection] in a minute.
%
[US Attorney Bill McSwain] was the U.S. Attorney who did absolutely nothing on the massive Election Fraud that took place in Philadelphia and throughout the commonwealth.
%
[US Attorney Bill McSwain] knew what was happening and let it go. It was there for the taking and he failed so badly.
%
You don't want to do that. You know the... I call it the N-word. Ok, I said that to a group of people. They said, "The N-word. Ohh he said a horrible thing." I said no, the nuclear word is what I trying...
%
"Oh, he said a horrible thing," The N-word. And I said, no, the N-word is the nuclear word. And the nuclear word is something that's not supposed to be discussed. You don't talk about it.
%
Putin's been talking about it. Yea, he's an amazing country, but he's a serious nuclear power and he's talking about it.
%
When I listen to him constantly using the N-word... that's the N-word, and he's constantly using it... the nuclear word. And we never talk .. we say "Oh, he's a nuclear power."
%
Anyone being investigated by the FBI is not qualified to be the President of the United States."
%
I'm not a good loser.
%
I don't like being called stupid.
%
Is there a test or something I can take to prove to these radical left maniacs that I'm much smarter than them?
%
And you know, now they don't call me stupid. They say "He's a dictator, he wants to take over the world."
%
First they said not too smart... but then, they made me a dictator instead. Which would you rather be, a dumb person or a dictator? Perhaps a dictator would be better. I don't want to be a dumb person.
%
They conspired to ban me from every social media platform. Because of this digital tyranny we had to give the American People their voice back by building something called Trothe, Truth Sential. [He surely meant Truth Social, but that's how he babbles.]
%
I don't talk constantly, but you brought it up. I didn't. You brought it up. Excuse me! I didn't talk about it very much.
%
I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH. I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.
%
When somebody says something about me [on Twitter], I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it.
%
If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, just knock the crap out of them would you?
%
They were going to throw fruit. We were threatened. We had a threat.
%
I thought Secret Service was involved in that, actually. And you get hit with fruit, it's, no, it's very violent stuff. We were on alert for that.
%
It was said sort of in jest. Buy maybe, you know, a little truth to it. It's very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things. [tomatoes]
%
Some fruit is a lot worse than -- tomatoes are bad by the way. But it's very dangerous ... they were going to hit -- they were going to hit very hard.
%
I brought back the old lightbulb. For personal reasons, I brought back the old lightbulb. Better light for much less money, if you want it. So the new lightbulb costs you five times as much and it makes you look orange. And I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost.
%
[Charles Herbster, who was called out for groping, has] been badly maligned and it's a shame. That's why I came out here. It would have been easy for me to say, 'I'm not gonna come.' I defend my people when I know they're good.
%
He's already got the proper defense. He doesn't even know about this stuff. That's the proper defense. Charles is a fine man. And he's innocent of these despicable charges [of groping and other sexual misconduct.]
%
Can't you just shoot [the protesters]? Just shoot them in the legs or something?
%
Well, shoot [the protesters] in the leg—or maybe the foot. But be hard on them!
%
This was yet another example of weaponizing Law Enforcement against the Republican Party and, in particular, the former President of the United States [Donald Trump].
%
As crime rates are soaring in our Nation's Capital, it is necessary that the Attorney General focus on those issues rather than a further leg of the greatest Witch-Hunt in political history.
%
We could just shoot some Patriot missiles and take out the [Mexican drug] labs, quietly.
%
So many Republicans are just not going to vote for Kemp.
%
I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth. I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.
%
Mark Esper was weak and totally ineffective and, because of it, I had to run the military.
%
Mark Esper was a stiff who was desperate not to lose his job. He would do anything I wanted, that's why I call him 'Yesper.'
%
[Mark Esper] was recommended to me by some very weak RINOs and that is what he turned out to be.
%
[Mark Vesper is] a highly respected gentleman with a great career — West Point, Harvard, a tremendous talent.
%
I wanted to send 10,000 troops for January 6, because I knew many people were coming to Washington that day to protest the corrupt President Election of 2020.
%
60 Minutes should ask them why they chose not to have proper security, which would have totally changed that day and allowed us to have a proper debate on massive Election Fraud, which the Fake News media still refuses to cover whatsoever.
%
I fired Yesper because he was a RINO incapable of leading, and I had to run the military myself.
%
Happy Mother's Day to all, including Racist, Vicious, Highly Partisan, Politically Motivated, and Very Unfair Radial Left Democrat Judges, Prosecutors, District Attorneys, and Attorney Generals, who campaign unrelentingly against you without knowing a thing, and endlessly promise to take you down.

Does China have the secret technology, a weapon, even, to create large man-made hurricanes, and then launch them at the United States? And if so, would this constitute an acto of war by a foreign power, and could the US retaliate militarily?

David [McCormick] is totally controlled ... by Mitch McConnell, the old crow, the old broken-down crow.

Dr. Oz is the only one who will be able to easily defeat the Crazed, Lunatic Democrat in Pennsylvania.

You know all about the Washington Post, you don't get a break with them.

There is no one in Pennsylvania who has done more, or fought harder, for Election Integrity than State Senator Doug Mastriano.
%
I think Twitter is going down.
%
Bots, Spam, Fake Accounts (and more!), all add up to big trouble but the biggest trouble of all for them them is that, no matter how many times they may ask, or admit they were wrong, I will never go back on Twitter again...

I doubt I would be here if it weren't for social media, to be honest with you.

When somebody says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it.

Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution, and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you, I'll tell you right now.

I guess these people [rioting on Capitol Hill] are more upset about the election than you are.

Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results. She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!)
%
Our country is in such trouble!
%
[January 6 represents] the greatest movement in the history of our country to Make America Great Again.
%
So the Unselect Committee of political HACKS refuses to play any of the many positive witnesses and statements, refuses to talk of the Election Fraud and Irregularities that took place on a massive scale.
%
I'm going to maybe - and I'm looking at it very seriously - we're doing some other things that you probably noticed like some of the very important things that we're doing now. But we're looking at it very seriously, because you can't do that.

I have broken more Elton John records. He seems to have a lot of records. And I, by the way, I don't have a musical instrument. I don't have a guitar or organ. No organ. Elton has an organ. And lots of other people helping. No, we've broken a lot of records. We've broken virtually every record.

[Homelessness is] a phenomenon that started two years ago. It's disgraceful.

I take full responsibility, but it's not my fault.

With regard to the forest, when trees fall down, after a short period of time, about 18 months, they become very dry. They become really, like a matchstick. And they get up, you know, there's no more water pouring through, and they become very, very - well, they just explode. They can explode.

My rhetoric brings people together.

I wanted to hit those speakers at the Democratic Convention so hard. I wanted to punch them right in the face - every last one of them. The voices alone on those women made me want to hit them.

A shutdown falls on the president's lack of leadership. A shutdown means the president is weak.

See Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak in 1963 - the "I had a dream" speech. One million people. And then I gave my speech, and they showed the same thing. It's hard to believe many, many decades later, but it's identical architecture, identical pools. My pictures were exactly the same but the people were slightly closer together. They were more compact, but exactly the same. But there were more people. They were tighter together... Am I allowed to say my speech is better? I don't think so. I better not play with that one.

I won't use the full expression, but [Prince] Harry is whipped like no other person I think I've seen.

We will also keep men out of women's sports. Right? The swimmer! The young swimmer, she went to break that record. One sixteenth of a second, she was gonna do it, and she looked over and said hello to people that she's grown up with... she looks left and sees him. "Hi, hi!" They hate each other but they're, you know they're competing. "Hi, hi!" They hate it. She hates them. That's the way life goes, right? Then she looks over and she sees this GUYYYY. They say, this is supposedly a technically correct thing, a person with a man's body, ok, it's a man's body. So she sees this person with a man's body, and he's a giant -- he's a big guy... wing span, so Mike, he broke the record by 38 seconds. And she was injured by wing burn as he went by her.

We have bigger problems than [climate change]. We'll have a little more beachfront property. That's not the worst thing in the world.

[Dr. Oz] always treated me well. He said I'm 'a 'very healthy specimen,' which I liked very much.

It's a lot of work. When I'm speaking in front of 15,000 and 20,000 people and I'm up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way it's a pretty healthy act. I really enjoy doing it. A lot of times these rooms are very hot, like saunas, and I guess that is a form of exercise and -- you know?

I hardly know who this person, Cassidy Hutchinson, is.

I could have said [to Elon Musk], "drop to your knees and beg," and he would have done it...

But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results... I don’t want to say the election is over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election is over, OK? [Jan 7 televised announcement outtake.]
%
A friend of mine recently said that I was the most persecuted person in the history of our country.
%
Our country is now a cesspool of crime.

We need an all-out effort to defeat violent crime in America, and strongly defeat it, and be tough and be nasty and be mean if we have to.
%
We have blood, death, and suffering on a scale once unthinkable because of the Democrat Party's effort to destroy and dismantle law enforcement all throughout America. [Apparently nothing to do with the lack of gun control!]
%
Open up large parcels of inexpensive land in the outer reaches of the cities. Bring medical professionals... Build permanent bathrooms... Create thousands and thousands of high quality tents [to deal with homelessness.]
%
The penalties should be very, very severe. If you look at countries throughout the world, the ones that don’t have a drug problem are ones that institute a very quick trial death penalty sentence for drug dealers.
%
It goes quickly, and you absolutely — you execute a drug dealer, and you’ll save 500 lives.
%
It’s terrible to say, but you take a look at every country in this world that doesn’t have a problem with drugs, they have a very strong death penalty for people that sell drugs.
%
We’re living in such a different country for one primary reason: There is no longer respect for the law, and there certainly is no order.

It was a catastrophe that election. A disgrace to our country.

We should not allow men to play women's sports, it's so disrespectful to women.

You can't be too greedy.

When I’m with [35 year old Tom Brady] I feel the same age as him. It’s crazy.

After working and co-operating with the relevant government agencies, this unannounced [FBI] raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.
%
Another day in paradise. This is a strange day. You probably all read about it. [In response to the FBI raiding Mar-a-Lago]
%
Nothing like this [search and siezure at Mar a Lago] has ever happened to a President of the United States before.
%
These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents. Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.

We are no better than a third world country, a banana republic.

Under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution. [Pleading the 5th in New York AG] [Remember when: "If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"]
%
My great company, and myself, are being attacked from all sides. Banana Republic!
%
If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment? Now I know the answer to that question. When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice.

I think everybody exaggerates about the value of their properties. Who wouldn't?

The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very... it just has gone up.

"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in." [Donald Trump paraphrasing from Al Wilson's 'The Snake,' which is ironically about immigrants and not about corruption.]
%
Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even 'safecrackers.
%
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.
%
The Justice Department and FBI are "leaking" at levels never seen before - and I did nothing wrong!!!
%
Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on “Nuclear,” a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - WE GAVE THEM MUCH.
%
Judge Bruce Reinhart should NEVER have allowed the Break-In of my home. He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.
%
In my administration, I'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.
%
You know, nobody else knows about it, but I know about Joe [Scarborough] and Mika’s [Brzezinski] little apartment in the Upper East Side. One day, I’ll tell you all about it.
%
Why are people so mean?
%
... it looks more and more like the Fake News Media is pushing hard for the Sleaze to do something that should not be done!
%
Terrible the way the FBI, during the Raid of Mar-a-Lago, threw documents haphazardly all over the floor (perhaps pretending it was me that did it!), and then started taking pictures of them for the public to see. Thought they wanted them kept Secret? Lucky I Declassified!
%
J.D. is kissing my ass he wants my support so bad.
%
The show is Trump, and it is sold-out performances everywhere.
%
[If I get indicted] I think you'd have problems in this country the likes of which perhaps we've never seen before.
%
The Storm is Coming. [From a Q pin worn by Donald Trump]
%
If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, ‘It’s declassified.’ Even by thinking about it.
%
Attorney General Letitia "Peekaboo" James, a total crime fighting disaster in New York, is spending all of her time fighting for very powerful and well represented banks and insurance companies, who were fully paid, made a lot of money, and never had a complaint about me.
%
[Attorney General Letitia James] is a failed A.G. whose lack of talent in the fight against crime is causing record numbers of people and companies to flee New York. Bye, bye!
%
I declassified EVERYTHING!
%
Boxes and boxes of pictures, newspaper articles, tremenda- even kitchen things. You have tremendous amounts of different items. Much clothing.
%
[The FBI] took a lot. I think they took my will. I found out yesterday. I said, "Where is it?"
%
There's also a lot of speculation because of what they did, the severity of the FBI coming and raiding Mar-a-Lago. Were they looking for the Hillary Clinto emails that were deleted, but they are around some place? They may have thought that it was in there!
%
Here's the way I look at it. I have so many rich friends and nobody knows who they are.
%
This thing is costing me a fortune, being president. It's probably costing me from $3 to $5 billion for the privilege of being -- and I couldn't care less -- I don't care. You know if you're wealthy, it doesn't matter.
%
[Jared Kushner] sounds like a child.
%
A lot of these people vote. [Trump on why he wouldn't denounce white supremists.]
%
If you leave, you're committing treason. [Trump on Gary Cohn's letter of resignation.]
%
I'll just sue Congress. They can't do this to me. [Trump on learning he was about to be impeached.]
%
Can't we do better lighting or give [Nikki Haley] better makeup?
%
Why don’t you get the canapes? [Trump assuming top congressional aides of colour were waiters.]
%
[Kara Young] inherited her beauty from her mother, and her intelligence from her dad, the white side.
%
I have Black friends.
%
[Mitch McConell] has a DEATH WISH. Must immediately seek help and advise from his China loving wife, Coco Chow!
%
... the Kim Jong Un letters, we have incredible things. I have incredible letters with other leaders.
%
Most people are surprised by the way I work. I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops ... I have at least a dozen meetings. The majority occur on the spur of the moment, and few of them last longer than fifteen minutes.
%
Nothing of great urgency. I have great things, though. You know, the letters to Kim Jong-Un. Letters. I had many of them. [When asked if he still had any mementos he took with him.]
%
[When taking back that he had the Kim Jong-Un love letters] Look at what is happening. No, I think that has the... I think *that's* in the Archives, but... most of it is in the Archives.
%
On December 31, 2009, CNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed singer Linda Rondstadt on her views of the Plaintiff [Trump] and her "comparisons between America under the President Donald Trump and Germany under the leadership of Adolph Hitler. No matter how lovely a voice she may have, Ronstadt is a singer, not a historian.
%
You know the biggest crowd I've ever seen? January 6th. And you never hear that. It was the biggest... and they were there, they were there largely to protest the corrupt and rigged and stolen election. It's the biggest crowd and you never hear that.
%
All we were doing was protesting a fake and dirty and rigged election. That's all we were doing [On January 6th].
%
We have a company that's very suspect. It's name is Dominion. With the turn of a dial, or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this?
%
In addition there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden, and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.
%
It's also because of the type of weaponry that we have available today. You would never have had weapons like this, the destructive capability of weapons - modern weapons. I know more about it than anybody because of the fact that I, we built our military.
%
I don’t want people to know we lost. This is embarrassing.
%
There are only two possible outcomes: Either I win, or it will be stolen from me.
%
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020 WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN!
%
I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.
%
USA demands the truth!
%
The Unselect Committee knowingly failed to examine the massive voter fraud which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election - The reason for what took place on January 6th.
%
So this is just a way they're trying to steal the election, and everybody knows that. Because the only way they're going to win is by a rigged election.
%
The Democrats are trying to rig this election because that's the only way they're going to win.
%
I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. ... We want to have -- get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very ... there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control. You know it.
%
But in terms of time, we go to January 20. But I think it's better if you go before the election because I think this -- this scam that the Democrats are pulling -- it's a scam -- this scam will be before the United States Supreme Court.
%
Why didn't razy Nancy Pelosi call out the "troops" before January 6th, which I strongly recommended that she do. It was her responsibility, but she "didn't like the look." Crazy Nancy failed the American People!
%
No President has done more for Israel than I have.
%
Jewish Americans either don't like Israel or don't care about Israel.
%
Evangelicals love Israel more than the Jews in this country.
%
Most people are surprised by the way I work.
%
You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.
%
MAGA doesn't vote for stupid people with big mouths. Good luck Joe [O'Dea]!
%
I want my documents back!
%
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK
%
Is this a good Jewish character right here?
%
You've got to love Trump. In Israel, I'm the most popular. With Orthodox, I'm the most popular.
%
Who's this Clinton appointed "Judge," David Carter ... please explain to this partisan hack that the Presidential Election of 2020 was Rigged and Stolen. Also, he shouldn't be making statements about me until e understands the facts, which he doesn't!
%
I do not intend to comment on this matter any further.
%
[Judge Gonzalo Curiel] is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall. I'm going to build a wall. I'm doing very well with the Latinos, with the Hispanics, with the Mexicans, I'm doing very well with them in my opinion.
%
It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.
%
Durham could not get a fair shake in the Swamp of biased and partisan juries, where you are told that no Republican based or supported case can be won no matter how good it is, & judges that are so biased, unfair and angry that it is literally dangerous to be in court!
%
How stupid can these people be, that are allowing our country to be ruined.
%
I will probably have to do it [run for president] again.
%
J.D. [Vance] is kissing my ass he wants my support so bad.
%
Well, Hope [Hicks] doesn't believe in me.
%
People are telling me about all the evidence.
%
I don't care about my legacy.
%
What you're talking about [moving on from the election] isn't even an option.
%
Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you.
%
I don't wear masks like him.
%
Every time you see him he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away and he shows up with biggest mask I've ever seen.
%
I thought [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] and President Putin, Vladimir Putin, were very reasonable. They knew they had a problem, and then this happened.
%
I have nothing to do with Russia - no deals, no loans, no nothing.
%
I’d think that they would like to see me in prison.
%
When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere... I could have said, "drop to your kneeds and beg," and he would hae done it...
%
[Kanye West has] made some ... rough statements on Jewish.
%
The heat in April will kill the Coronavirus. Generally speaking, heat kills this kind of virus and it will go away.
%
There it is, Trump at 71, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10 percent.
%
A BIG MISTAKE!
%
Here we go again! Rigged Election! [Days before the 2022 mid-term elections]
%
Reports are coming in from Arizona that the Voting MAchines are not properly working in predominantly Republican/Conservative areas... Here we go again? The people will not stand for it.
%
There's not a tiff with me, and I'm way up in the polls.
%
If Mr. DeSantis were to announce a presidential bid, [I might] reveal things about him that won't be very flattering. I know more about him than anybody - other than, perhaps, his wife, who is really running his campaign.
%
I think [Ron DeSantis] would be making a mistake [running for president]. I think the base would not like it.
%
I don't know if [Ron DeSantis] is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very bodly. I really believe he could hurt himself badly. I don't think it would be good for the party.
%
Well, I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.
%
You're going to say, 'Please Mr. President, I have a headache. Please, don't win so much. This is getting terrible.' And I'm going to say, 'No, we have to make America great again.' You're gonna say, 'Please.' I said, 'Nope, nope. We're gonna keep winning.'
%
While in certain ways yesterday's election was somewhat disappointing, from my personal standpoint it was a very big victory.
%
I don't want to see 'Pence Opposes Gohmert Suit' as a headline this morning... If it gives you [Mike Pence] the power [to overturn the election], why would you oppose it?
%
When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that's the way it's got to be.
%
You're [Mike Pence] too honest. Hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts... People are gonna think you're stupid.
%
Ron DeSanctimonious is playing games! The Fake News asks him if he's going to run if President Trump runs, and he says, 'I'm only focused on the Governor's race, I'm not looking into the future.' Well, in terms of loyalty and class, that's really not the right answer.
%
They stole the Electron from Blake Masters. Do Election over again!
%
This is a scam and voter fraud, no different than stuffing the ballot boxes.
%
Remember, I am a 'Stable Genius.'
%
Well, I'm gonna have to say you did a great disservice [to Mike Pence, for not attempting to overturn the election results].
%
I’ve gone decades without a war. The longest of any President ever.
%
In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.
%
Many people think because of that, China played a very active role in the 2020 election. Just saying... just saying. Sure that didn't happen.
%
The Green New Deal, and the environment that they say may affect us, in 300 yyears, is all that is talked about. They say the ocean will rise 1/8th of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years, but don't worry about nuclear weapons.
%
They don't quite feel it yet, but they will very soon. I have no doubt that by 2024 it will sadly be much worse, and they will see much more clearly what happened and what is happening to our country. And the voting will be much more different. 2024.
%
We have taken over congress. Nancy Pelosi has been fired.
%
Reconstruction. I guess that's what you call the Civil War. That's what I call it.
%
I call [President Xi] King.
%
We completed the wall.
%
I will restore public safety in American cities and other communities that need our help, and if they don't want our help we're going to insist they take our help this time.
%
These are savages. They say, 'please don't use that name. They're people.' No, they're not. These are savages.
%
We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts, because it's the only way.
%
I looked at President Xi and asked him, "Do you have a drug problem?" He said "No no no no, we don't." He looked at me like I don't know what I was doing.
%
We will not men, as an example, participate in women's sports.
%
I'm a victim. I will tell you. I'm a victim.
%
Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand.
%
If you get caught dealing drugs in China, you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That's a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.
%
North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the "Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times." Will someone from his deplete and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his, and my Button works!
%
Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order
%
Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country.

Truth Social has been very, very powerful, very, very strong, and I’ll be staying there. [Posted shortly after Elon Musk re-instigated @realDonaldTrump on Twitter.]

%
The case should be dismissed immediately, and the large, highly paid and "prestigious" accounting firm that we RELIED on to do their job, but didn't, should pay us a fortune in damages.
%
No "Fringe Benefits" case like this has ever been brought before. A total Witch Hunt!
%
DO THE ELECTION OVER, or declare Kari, Blake, Abe the winners. Act Fast!!!
%
The Supreme Court of the United States has the lowest Approval Rating in its long and storied history. [Remember Donald stacked the Supreme Court that he now disparages.]
%
We need Strength and Wisdom, NOW!
%
This Fake case against "Trump" has totally collapsed, even the Media says so. We had NOTHING to do with these small Fringe Benefits.
%
FREEDOM!
%
I told [Kanye West] he should definitely not run for President. Any voters you may have should vote for TRUMP!
%
So I help a seriously man, who just happened to be black, Ye (Kanye West), who has been decimated in his business and virtually everything else, and who has always been good to me, by allowing his request for a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, alone, so that I can give him very much needed "advice."
%
When will you invade other Presidents' homes in search of documents, which are voluminous, which they took with them, but not nearly as openly and transparently as I did.
%
Don’t ask that guy—he wants to hang them all! [re: Mike Pence's hatred toward the LGBT... population.]
%
This fully weaponized monster, Jack Smith, shouldn't be let anywhere near te political persecution of "President Donald J. Trump." I did nothing wrong on January 6th, and nothing wrong with the Democrats' fix on the Document Hoax, that is, unless the six previous presidents did something wrong also....
%
People have been treated unconstitutionally in my opinion and very, very unfairly, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.
%
Our great "Founders" did not want, and would not dondone, False & Fraudlent Elections!
%
Do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great "Founders" did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!
%
Joe Biden is a criminаl and has been a criminаl for a long time.

An unprecidented fraud requires an unprecidented cure.

MANHATTAN WITCH HUNT!

New York is a hard place to be 'Trump.'

[I'm] hopefully your favorite president of all time, better than Lincoln, better than Washington.
%
Each card comes with an automatic chance to win amazing prizes like dinner with me. I don't know if that's an amazing prize, but it's what we have.
%
AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO!
%
Hopefully [Kevin McCarthy]'s going to be very strong and going to be very good and he's going to do what everybody wants.
%
I'm friendly with a lot of those people who are against Kevin. I think almost every one of them are very much inclined toward Trump, and me toward them. But I have to tell them, and I have told them, you're playing a very dangerous game.
%
Mitch McConnell, who is an absolute disaster, by the way... [is] more of a Democrat than a Republican. What he is doing to this party is incredible.
%
I'm the President and I'll decide where I get to go.
%
Merry Christmas to EVERYONE, including the Radical Left Marxists that are trying to destroy our Country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation that is illegally coercing & paying Social and LameStream Media to push for a mentally disabled Democrat over the Brilliant, Clairvoyant, and USA LOVING Donald J. Trump, and, of course, The Department of Injustice, which appointed a Special 'Prosecuter' who, together with his wife and family, HATES 'Trump' more than any other person on earth. LOVE TO ALL!
%
The Fake & Corrupt News is only getting worse!
%
I agreed to do a short telephone interview for a once very good, but now on its 'last legs' and failing, New York Magazine. The reporter was a shaky & unattractive wack job, known as 'tough' but dumb as a rock, who actually wrote a decent story about me a long time ago.
%
The USA is dying from within!!!
%
I’m leading BIG in the Polls!
%
'WE HAVE ALMOST TWO YEARS TO GO.' The Rallies will be bigger and better than ever (because our Country is going to Hell), but it’s a little bit early, don’t you think?
%
I never asked Jared or Ivanka to be part of the 2024 Campaign for President and, in fact, specifically asked them not to do it - too mean and nasty with the Fake & Corrupt News and having to deal with some absolutely horrendous SleazeBags in the world of politics, and beyond.
%
I ran twice, getting millions more Votes the second time (RIGGED), & am doing it again!
%
We had the most SECURE Border in our history, versus the 'horror show' that that is happening now, with record setting numbers of people, many of them hardened Criminals (including Killers, Human Traffickers and Drug Dealers), POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY at a rate the likes of which we have never seen before.
%
TODAY, LIKE NEVER BEFORE, WE ARE A NATION IN DECLINE, A FAILING NATION!
%
The Marxist Democrats must have something really big on Mitch McConnell in order to get him and some of his friendly 'Republican' Senators to pass the horrendous “All Democrat, All the Way” OMINOUS Bill.
%
[The omnibus bill] fully funds the corrupt 'Justice' Department, FBI (which RIGGED the Presidential Election!), and even the Trump Hating Special 'Prosecutor.'
%
It is also a massive giveaway & capitulation to CHINA, making COCO CHOW so happy!
%
If the Old Crow [Mitch McConnell] waited just 10 days, the Republican Majority in the House could have made the 'Ominous' Bill MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER.
%
Just another win for the Democrats, Mitch, that wouldn’t have happened if 'Trump' were President!
%
I don’t need anybody’s advice! I don’t need any advice! I’m pretty good. I think I’m pretty good at doing advice.
%
I didn’t know that Kanye said anything negative about Israel because it’s not exactly something that I would be in a position to know.
%
There was no insurrection, and there wasn't going to be an insurrection.
%
Think of it: I lunged for a steering wheel! And they believed that story! Nobody believes that story!
%
The only thing they're good at: Cheating at elections, and misinformation.
%
NUMBER OE, as President, I have total Immunity. Number two, I did nothing wrong.
%
Even Shifty Schiff got into the act again. SAD!!!
%
We are a Nation in serious decline, a failing Nation. Somehow, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
%
We have a weaponized Department of Injustice. Very dangerous!
%
The Democrats should have never [released Trump's returns], the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it's going to lead to horrible things for so many people.
%
The 'Trump' tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.
%
America’s comeback starts right now.
%
In order to make America great and glorious again I’m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.
%
I will immediately demand voter ID, same-day voting, and only paper ballots.
%
REPUBLICANS, DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT.
%
Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB—JUST WATCH!
%
They call me the music man sometimes.
%
We need Honest Elections and Strong Borders for our Country to again be Great!
%
I know what crazy is. I know all about crazy.
%
Jack Smith(?), is a Trump Hating THUG [who] put a high ranking government official in prison because he was a Trump positive person. [Actually it was because Salih Mustafa was a war lord charged for raping, murdering and harvesting organs from his victims, but we won't let the truth get in the way of a Trump narative!]
%
The Boxes Scam is a HOAX...
%
[Jack] Smith is known as an unfair Savage.
%
Fire a man who may very well be a criminal, Jack Smith. His conflicts, unfairness, and mental state of derangement make him unfit for the job of "getting Trump."
%
Like Bill Barr, the U.S. Attorneys in Delaware and Illinois are weak, ineffective, and afraid to do what must be done. The Election wass RIGGED... We can't let that happen.
%
Merrick Garland has to immediately end Special Counsel investigation into anything related to me because I did everything right, and appointed a Special Counsel to investigate Joe Biden who hates Biden as much as Jack Smith hates me.
%
Gas stoves are better, but you must be able to choose for yourself!
%
Nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9/11 unfortunately, and they should have, as to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world. So, nobody's really been there.
%
There's great disloyalty in the world of politics... I thought [Evangelicals] could have fought much harder for the election, during the 22 election, because you know they won [dismantling of Roe v. Wade].
%
Nobody has done more for the movement than I have. And that includes the movement of Evangelicals and Christians, and the movement very much of Right to Life.
%
Nobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump. I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they’ve [Evangelicals] been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years.
%
President Trump’s unmatched record speaks for itself – nominating pro-life federal judges and Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe v. Wade, ending tax-payer funded abortions, reinstating the Mexico City Policy that protects the life of the unborn abroad, and many other actions that championed the life of the unborn. There has been no bigger advocate for the movement than President Trump.
%
The Fake News Media & Crooked Democrats (That's been proven!) keep saying I had a "large number of documents" in order to make the Biden Classified Docs look less significant.
%
I did NOTHING WRONG. JOE DID!
%
Why aren't they asking President Obama what's going on with his administration?
%
Maybe Trump Hating Special "Prosecuter" Jack Smith,, who is doing the dirty work for his Marxist Democrat friends, should do the right thing for our Country!
%
Our Country has become the Investigation Capital of the World. Actually, that's all we do, and it's good for our many enemies. They could not be happier as they brilliantly plot our demise!!!
%
I'm being persecuted by Trump hating Special Council. I call them Special Prosecuters, but this one in particular is a prosecuter and a Trump deranged person.
%
Biden lied to the American people and weaponized the Justice Department. Or as I call it, the Injustice Department.
%
While I did everything right, I did nothing wrong. Biden did everything wrong.
%
When I return to the Whitehouse, we will end the era of partisan witch hunts.
%
The Boxes hoax should be dropped immediately against President Trump.
%
My phone call to the Secretary of State of Georgia, and a second call which the Marxists, Communists, Racists, and RINOS don’t even want to talk about, were “PERFECT” calls. Many people, including lawyers for both sides, were knowingly on the line. I was protesting a RIGGED & STOLEN Election, which evidence proves it was.
%
I won Georgia by a lot, but only needed a small number of votes from that total number. They cheated in many ways including STUFFING Ballots, ALL CAUGHT LIVE ON TAPE.
%
How come not one person said, while on the call, that I acted inappropriately, or made a statement of protest at what I said, & then slammed down the phone? Not one, even with so many opposing people, lawyers, and others on the line. NO ADMONISHMENT at all.
%
Mike Pence is an innocent man. He never did anything knowingly dishonest in his life. Leave him alone!!
%
We nicely agreed to speak again.
%
You should want to have an accurate election. And you're a republican.
%
They are moving machinery and they're moving it as fast as they can. Both of which are criminal finds. And you can't let that happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm *notifying* you that you are letting it happen.
%
So tell me, Brad, what are we doing to do? We won the election, and it's not fair to take that away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it. And you can reexamine it. But reexamine it with people that want to find answers. Not people who don't want to find answers.
%
One of the greatest privileges I had as president was firing Deborah Birx. The only thing she had going was nice scarves.
%
There are Republican governors that did not close their states. Florida was closed for a long period of time. They’re trying to rewrite history.
%
Ron [DeSantis] would have not been governor if it wasn’t for me. So when I hear he might run, I consider that very disloyal.
%
I talked to [Nikki Haley] for a little while, I said, 'Look, you know, go by your heart if you want to run.' She’s publicly said that 'I would never run against my president, he was a great president.'
%
I recently won big money against “Stormy” in the 9th Circuit – NEVER HAD AN AFFAIR.
%
Radical Left Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, just leaked to the Fake News Media that they are still going after the Stormy ”Horseface” Daniels Bull....!
%
So then when I hear he might run, I consider that very disloyal. But it’s not about loyalty – but to me it is, it’s always about loyalty – but for a lot of people it’s not about loyalty.
%
Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool – an absolute fool.
%
We cannot permit a renegade and out of control prosecutor to use this investigation as a means of advancing her political career.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the answer is yes [to Judge Letitia James]

This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. There has never been another president or perhaps even another polititian who has been persecuted, harassed and in every other way, unfairly treated like President Donald J. Trump.
%
What Leticia James has tried to do the last number of years is a disgrace to the legal system, an affront to the New York State taxpayers, and a violation of the solemn rights and protections afforded by the United States Constitution.
%
[Letitia James] developed a political platform and made a career out of maliciously attacking me and my business, before she even understood or was elected, or reviewed one of the millions of pages of documents we willingly produced - we willingly produced those documents.
%
We cannot permit a renegade and out of control prosecutor to use this investigation as a means of advancing her political career. New York deserves better, and this country deserves better.
%
I am being hit by so many DEMOCRAT Prosecutors, LOCAL, STATE, & FEDERAL, all to keep me from "running," and all because I am leading by sooo much. The great people of our Country aren't going to take it.
%
It's all WEAPONIZED POLITICS. So Sad!
%
We will save our country from doom and make America great again, and you're gonna be the biggest part of it!
%
Be careful Fox News. Don't go that way. They've got failed politician Paul Ryan, and RINO Carl Rove, a total loser running things.
%
With respect to the 'Stormy' nonsense, it is VERY OLD & happened a long time ago, long past the very publicly known and accepted deadline of the Statute of Limitations.
%
Because of the Weaponization, Targeting, and Unprecedented Harassment, I believe that I have more lawyers working for me on this Corrupt Law Enforcement induced Bull…. than any human being in the history of our Country, including even the late great gangster, Alphonse Capone!
%
This is all being done for POLITICAL REASONS in that I am leading everybody, Republicans & Democrats, by big numbers in the Polls. The Disinformation Specialists are at it again, full time. The Fake News is their TOOL!
%
Remember in Helsinki when a 3rd rate reporter asked me, essentially, who I trusted more, President Putin of Russia, or our 'Intelligence' lowlifes... Who would you chose Putin or these Misfits? [former FBI officials James Comey and Andrew McCabe, Hilary Clinton, and several others]
%
The Disinformation Specialists are at it again, full time. The Fake News is their TOOL!
%
If you want to see our country go to Hell even faster than its current pace, support CLUB FOR NO GROWTH. These are RINOS and others who don't have a clue!
%
[To the Lincoln Project] Don't forget, you come after us, and we come after you!
%
The Club For No Growth is a GLOBALIST group that I have been taking to the cleaners for years.
%
Ron DeSanctimonious, who I made Governor in BOTH the Primary & the General, is also a Globalist, & so are his donors.
%
The real Ron [DeSantis] is a RINO GLOBALIST, who closed quickly down Florida and even its beaches. Loved the Vaccines and wasting big money on "Testing." How quickly people forget!
%
Look, [Biden] worked hard tonight [presenting his SOTU 2023 speech], it's not a natural thing for him, it never was, and never will be, but you've got to give him credit for tryng. I disagree with him on most of his policies, but he put into words what he felt, and he ended up the evening far stronger than he began. Give him credit for that.
%
I'm the one that did the great job on Insulin pricing, the Dems just got the benefit of that success. It was passed on to them, and now they brag about it.
%
Mitch McConnell looks like Hell, so bad for the Republican Party!
%
[Biden] forgot to thank Mitch McConnell and his wife, Coco Chow, for giving him all of the Trillions of Dollars to waste!
%
I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
%
... it would be totally inappropriate to use the word "meatball" as a moniker for Ron [DeSantis]!
%
Thank you to the Special Grand Jury in the Great State of Georgia for your Patriotism & Courage. Total exoneration. The USA is very proud of you!!! [It seems DJT didn't realize they want him indicted.]
%
This is the real crime that took place in Georgia, with a Racist in Reverse D.A., who presides over the most dangerous city per capita in our Nation (by far!), Atlanta, does nothing but harass me for making two absolutely PERFECT phone calls, and for any other fake reason that the Department of Injustice in D.C. tells her to pursue.
%
[Kim Jong Un] feels threatened. Even I would constantly complain that South Korea pays us very little to do these extremely expensive and provocative drills. It's really ridiculous.
%
The sirens that went off in Ukraine during Biden's speech were STAGED, FAKE, PHONY. He knew it, and so did everyone else. Scam!
%
We're bringing thousands of bottles of water - [12 year old] Trump Water, actually. Some of it we had to go to a much lesser quality of water. You want to get those Trump bottles, I think, more than anybody else.
%
Mad Dog Psycho Jack Smith, put there for only one reason by Biden, and the Weaponized Justice Department, should stop this Witch Hunt altogether or, at a minimum, should give Biden, Obama, and all the others the same treatment!
%
This prosecutor should resign. He's got a conflict. My prosecutor... his name is Jack Smith. I wonder what his name was before Smith. I don't know, maybe it was Smith, but it seems like such a nice name: Jack Smith. Uh, he is a terrorist.
%
[Jack Smith's] wife hates Trump, probably even beyond him. And his wife has a sister who openly hates, like a level you can't even believe. And this is the man that's gonna give me fair...
%
[Jack Smith] as a prosecuture in Europe, according to Ric Grenell, put a high government official in prison because he was a Trump positive person.
%
[Jack] Smith is known as "an unfair Savage," & is best friends with the craziest Trump Haters
%
The Boxes Scam is a HOAX...
%
Two perfect phone calls on Election Integrity, that's it! The D.A. should go after the murderers and other violent criminals in Atlanta, one of the most dangerous cities in the World, and leave honest people alone!
%
I will be at CPAC on Saturday, talking about the fact that, obviously, our Country is going to "HELL," and how to fix it.
%
THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR ME, THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU -- I'M JUST IN THEIR WAY!!!
%
They've weaponized justice in our country.
%
There are probably people that I wouldn’t be very happy about endorsing that are running, so we’ll see. I think some of them – I won’t use names, I don’t want to insult anybody – but some of them, I would not be very happy about.
%
We have to change our thinking, because some bad things happened.
%
I am the only candidate who can make this promise: I will prevent World War Three.
%
In 2016, I declared: I am your voice. Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution. I am your retribution.
%
I will totally obliterate the deep state. I will fire the unelected bureaucrats and shadow forces who have weaponized our justice system like it has never been weaponized before.
%
[I will pass a law] prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states.
%
This is the final battle – they know it, I know it, you know it, everybody knows it.
%
We had a Republican Party that was ruled by freaks, neocons, globalists, open border zealots and fools but we are never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.
%
Joe Biden is leading us into oblivion.
%
Before I arrive in the Oval Office, I will have the disasterous war between Russia and Ukraine ended... I know what to say.
%
We have no choice. This is the final battle. If we don't do this, our country will be lost forever.
%
If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over, and America will be a free nation once again.
%
"Trump" and most others are totally innocent, LET THEM GO FREE, NOW!
%
Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. … I will get the problem solved. And I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day. I know exactly what to say to each of them. I got along very well with Putin.
%
I am the only candidate who can make this promise, I will prevent, very easily, World War III. We are going to have World War III, by the way, if something doesn’t happen fast.
%
I sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he’s got some money left over.
%
We are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign endless wars but demands we cut veteran benefits and retirement benefits at home.
%
We will evict Joe Biden from the White House and we will liberate America from these villains and scoundrels once and for all.
%
At the end of the day, anyone else will be intimidated, bought off, blackmailed or ripped to shreds. I alone will never retreat.
%
As you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall and Biden, they all took it away. And they hid it. They actually took it away and they hid it. They put it in a hiding area.
%
The racist Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who is presiding over one of the most dangerous and violent cities in the United Straights...
%
I'll challenge the governors of all 50 spates [sic].
%
We will support Baby Boomers. And we will support Baby Bonuses for a new Baby Boom. How does that sound? That sounds good. I want a baby boom. Oh, you men are so lucky out there. You're so lucky. You are so lucky, men.
%
I'm not a doctor, but I have a very good you-know-what.
